Here’s a high-level, shareable story for **Neighbor Engineers**:

# What Neighbor Engineers is

A nonprofit, Alabama-wide community that connects engineers and technologists—students to industry veterans—with the people, roles, and events that move careers forward. It’s a light, semi-professional network: the **website as a clean hub**, and **Chip** (our channel-agnostic AI concierge) as the everyday guide over text.

# Purpose

Reduce friction and increase serendipity across the state’s engineering ecosystem. Neighbor Engineers makes it easy to find high-signal jobs, mentors, meetups, and introductions—without another feed to babysit or a forum to moderate.

# What it offers (for each audience)

* **Students & new grads:** curated roles, mentor chats, portfolio nudges, and nearby events that are actually worth showing up to.
* **Working engineers:** targeted opportunities, warm intros, coffee chats, and a quiet way to give back as a mentor.
* **Recruiters & hiring managers:** clean role intake, smart matching to likely candidates, and paced, opt-in outreach (no spam).
* **Schools, meetups, and partners:** a clearer path to the right audiences and signal on what’s working locally.

# How it works (at a glance)

* **Start anywhere:** text Chip on your preferred channel or browse the hub.
* **Speak naturally:** say what you’re after (or what you’re unsure about); Chip turns that into the next best step—apply, meet, RSVP, or learn.
* **Learn as we go:** quick feedback (“that meetup fizzled,” “great intro”) improves your suggestions and informs smarter recommendations for others.
* **Small tools when needed:** Chip can spin up tiny, purpose-built micro-webapps (quick scheduler, QR generator, job compare view) to make a moment faster and clearer.

# Principles & guardrails

Friendly, concise, and useful by default. Consent-based introductions, respect for quiet hours and preferences, transparent “why you’re seeing this,” and a clear code of conduct. No open feeds, no mass blasts—quality over volume.

# Why it matters

Alabama’s engineering strength is spread across cities and sectors. Neighbor Engineers stitches it together so people waste less time hunting and more time building—creating better matches, stronger teams, and a healthier talent pipeline for the state.

**One-liner options**

* *Where Alabama’s engineers find what’s next—jobs, mentors, and real connections, one simple message at a time.*
* *A nonprofit network for Alabama’s builders—lightweight, human, and actually helpful.*
* *The quiet switchboard for Alabama engineering: fewer tabs, better matches, more momentum.*
