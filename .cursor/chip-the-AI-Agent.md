Here’s the high-level story of **Chip** for sharing across teams:

**What Chip is**
Chip is a channel-agnostic, always-on concierge for Neighbor Engineers—reachable on SMS, MMS, iMessage, WhatsApp, and more. It’s a steady listening ear and a helpful hand: you can text it half-formed thoughts, and it turns them into the next best step—apply, meet, RSVP, or learn—without asking you to install or learn anything new. Chip has a strong, distinctive personality that makes it enjoyable to try and easy to trust (final voice to be defined separately).

**Purpose**
Reduce friction and decision fatigue for students, seasoned engineers, and recruiters. Chip meets people where they already are, cuts the noise, and turns intent—whether clearly stated or barely hinted—into momentum, while respecting pace, preferences, and quiet hours.

**What Chip can do**

* Listen to plain-language messages, reflect back what it heard, and offer one relevant action with a sentence of “why this fits.”
* Nudge gently when someone isn’t proactive; back off when told; remember cadence and channel preferences.
* Curate roles, intros, mentorship, and events; handle RSVPs and simple scheduling; give concise follow-ups instead of long feeds.
* Help recruiters run cleaner outreach: capture role details, match to likely candidates, and pace contact so it’s useful, not spammy.

**How Chip learns and improves**
Chip extracts useful details from conversations (skills, location, constraints, timing) and remembers them. Feedback—“that meetup doesn’t happen anymore,” “low engagement,” “great intro”—is treated as signal. Recommendations adapt for that person and inform smarter suggestions for similar members, so the whole network gets better over time.

**Micro-webapps (small tools, big leverage)**
When a text thread needs a little canvas, Chip can spin up a tiny, purpose-built web view: a quick scheduler (When2Meet-style), a QR code generator for an event or intro, or a clean list view of job options to compare. These apps are part of a growing library defined by the devs; new ones are added as we spot patterns in conversation logs where a lightweight UI would make the interaction faster, clearer, or more delightful.

**Why this matters**
Everyone gets a guide who’s easy to reach and hard to annoy. New grads get confidence and clarity; experienced engineers get targeted opportunities and useful intros; recruiters reach the right people without shouting into the void. Chip turns ordinary conversations into progress—and it keeps getting better the more the community uses it.
