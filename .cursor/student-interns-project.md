Goals of the Project:
Develop an SMS/MMS/OTT agnostic message-based AI-powered agent with a clear and distinct personality that will assist members of the tech community in Alabama in connecting with each other, finding job opportunities, leveling themselves up with projects, and more.

The data collected by the agent from users is meant to be used by the agent so that it can intelligently leverage the network of people who text it to help those same people achieve their professional and career goals.

To properly have the AI agent benefit from both the network effect it causes and the data it has to trigger a flywheel, it must have automated evals on some set of metrics that a developer can tweak, but generally is meant to self-update (via meta-prompting or other prompt optimization method, think DSPy optimizers) to reach developer chosen metric goals.

Problem statement:
The Innovation Portal aims to catalyze innovation across Mobile, the Gulf Coast, and Alabama through diverse programs and initiatives. Many residents remain unaware of the region’s opportunities, companies, and jobs, as this information is often shared only within small circles.
While our co-working space has expanded access through entrepreneurial and business events, its reach is still limited. This project seeks to broaden awareness and connect more people across Alabama to these valuable resources.
Statement of work:
Define and create initial AI personality
Build tools for the Agent input and search of the data from conversations
Build tools for the Agents outputs and search of web data
Set up Prompt otptimizations for Agent conversations and tool calls
Automate data flywheel for continuous prompt optimization

Technology requirements/ constraints:
DSPy
Python
FastAPI
