## JigsawStack 🧩

<br />

[JigsawStack](https://jigsawstack.com/) is a powerful AI SDK designed to integrate into any backend, automating tasks such as web scraping, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), translation, and more, using 
Large Language Models (LLMs). By plugging JigsawStack into your existing application infrastructure, you can offload the heavy lifting and focus on building.

The [JigsawStack Prompt Engine]() is a feature that allows you to not only leverage LLMs but automatically choose the best LLM for every one of your prompts, delivering lightning-fast inference speed and performance
powered by Groq with features including:

- **Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) Approach:** Automatically selects the best LLMs for your task, combining outputs for higher quality and faster results.
- **Prompt Caching:** Optimizes performance for repeated prompt runs.
- **Automatic Prompt Optimization:** Improves performance without manual intervention.
- **Response Schema Validation:** Ensures accuracy and consistency in outputs.

The Propt Engine also comes with a built-in prompt guard feature via Llama Guard3 powered by Groq, which helps prevent prompt injection and a wide range of unsafe categories when activated, such as:
- Privacy Protection
- Hate Speech Filtering
- Sexual Content Blocking
- Election Misinformation Prevention
- Code Interpreter Abuse Protection
- Unauthorized Professional Advice Prevention

<br />

To get started, refer to the JigsawStack documentation [here](https://docs.jigsawstack.com/integration/groq) and learn how to set up your Prompt 
Engine [here](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/tree/main/tutorials/jigsawstack-prompt-engine).

# Compound

While LLMs excel at generating text, [`compound-beta`](/docs/compound/systems/compound-beta) takes the next step. 
It's an advanced AI system that is designed to solve problems by taking action and intelligently uses external tools - starting with web search and code execution - alongside the powerful Llama4 models and Llama3.370b model.
This allows it access to real-time information and interaction with external environments, providing more accurate, up-to-date, and capable responses than an LLM alone.

**Groq's compound AI system should not be used by customers for processing protected health information as it is not a HIPAA Covered Cloud Service under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. This system is also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.**

## Available Compound Systems

There are two compound systems available:
 - [`compound-beta`](/docs/compound/systems/compound-beta): supports multiple tool calls per request. This system is great for use cases that require multiple web searches or code executions per request.
 - [`compound-beta-mini`](/docs/compound/systems/compound-beta-mini): supports a single tool call per request. This system is great for use cases that require a single web search or code execution per request. `compound-beta-mini` has an average of 3x lower latency than `compound-beta`.

 

Both systems support the following tools:

- [Web Search](/docs/web-search)
- Code Execution via [E2B](https://e2b.dev/) (only Python is currently supported)

<br/>

Custom [user-provided tools](/docs/tool-use) are not supported at this time.

## Quickstart

To use compound systems, change the `model` parameter to either `compound-beta` or `compound-beta-mini`:
<br />

And that's it!

<br/>

When the API is called, it will intelligently decide when to use search or code execution to best answer the user's query.
These tool calls are performed on the server side, so no additional setup is required on your part to use agentic tooling.

<br/>

In the above example, the API will use its build in web search tool to find the current weather in Tokyo.
If you didn't use compound systems, you might have needed to add your own custom tools to make API requests to a weather service, then perform multiple API calls to Groq to get a final result.
Instead, with compound systems, you can get a final result with a single API call.

## Executed Tools

To view the tools (search or code execution) used automatically by the compound system, check the `executed_tools` field in the response:

## Use Cases

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/use-cases

# Use Cases

Groq's compound systems excel at a wide range of use cases, particularly when real-time information is required.

## Real-time Fact Checker and News Agent

Your application needs to answer questions or provide information that requires up-to-the-minute knowledge, such as:
- Latest news
- Current stock prices
- Recent events
- Weather updates

Building and maintaining your own web scraping or search API integration is complex and time-consuming.

### Solution with Compound Beta
Simply send the user's query to `compound-beta`. If the query requires current information beyond its training data, it will automatically trigger its built-in web search tool to fetch relevant, live data before formulating the answer.

### Why It's Great
- Get access to real-time information instantly without writing any extra code for search integration
- Leverage Groq's speed for a real-time, responsive experience

### Code Example

## Natural Language Calculator and Code Extractor

You want users to perform calculations, run simple data manipulations, or execute small code snippets using natural language commands within your application, without building a dedicated parser or execution environment.

### Solution with Compound Beta

Frame the user's request as a task involving computation or code. `compound-beta-mini` can recognize these requests and use its secure code execution tool to compute the result.

### Why It's Great
 - Effortlessly add computational capabilities
 - Users can ask things like:
 - "What's15% of $540?"
 - "Calculate the standard deviation of [10,12,11,15,13]"
 - "Run this python code: print('Hello from Compound Beta!')"

### Code Example

## Code Debugging Assistant

Developers often need quick help understanding error messages or testing small code fixes. Searching documentation or running snippets requires switching contexts.

### Solution with Compound Beta
Users can paste an error message and ask for explanations or potential causes. Compound Beta Mini might use web search to find recent discussions or documentation about that specific error. Alternatively, users can provide a code snippet and ask "What's wrong with this code?" or "Will this Python code run: ...?". It can use code execution to test simple, self-contained snippets.

### Why It's Great
- Provides a unified interface for getting code help
- Potentially draws on live web data for new errors
- Executes code directly for validation
- Speeds up the debugging process

**Note**: `compound-beta-mini` uses one tool per turn, so it might search OR execute, not both simultaneously in one response.

## Chart Generation

Need to quickly create data visualizations from natural language descriptions? Compound Beta's code execution capabilities can help generate charts without writing visualization code directly.

### Solution with Compound Beta
Describe the chart you want in natural language, and Compound Beta will generate and execute the appropriate Python visualization code. The model automatically parses your request, generates the visualization code using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn, and returns the chart.

### Why It's Great
- Generate charts from simple natural language descriptions
- Supports common chart types (scatter, line, bar, etc.)
- Handles all visualization code generation and execution
- Customize data points, labels, colors, and layouts as needed

## AutoGen + Groq: Building Multi-Agent AI Applications

[AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/) developed by [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/research/) is an open-source framework for building multi-agent AI applications. By powering the
AutoGen agentic framework with Groq's fast inference speed, you can create sophisticated AI agents that work together to solve complex tasks fast with features including:

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Create and manage multiple agents that can collaborate in realtime
- **Tool Integration:** Easily connect agents with external tools and APIs
- **Flexible Workflows:** Support both autonomous and human-in-the-loop conversation patterns
- **Code Generation & Execution:** Enable agents to write, review, and execute code safely


### Python Quick Start (3 minutes to hello world)
####1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install autogen-agentchat~=0.2 groq
```

####2. Configure your Groq API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

####3. Create your first multi-agent application with Groq:
In AutoGen, **agents** are autonomous entities that can engage in conversations and perform tasks. The example below shows how to create a simple two-agent system with `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` where
`UserProxyAgent` initiates the conversation with a question and `AssistantAgent` responds:

```python
import os
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

# Configure
config_list = [{
 "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
 "api_key": os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
 "api_type": "groq"
}]

# Create an AI assistant
assistant = AssistantAgent(
 name="groq_assistant",
 system_message="You are a helpful AI assistant.",
 llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
)

# Create a user proxy agent (no code execution in this example)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
 name="user_proxy",
 code_execution_config=False
)

# Start a conversation between the agents
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
 assistant,
 message="What are the key benefits of using Groq for AI apps?"
)
```


### Advanced Features

#### Code Generation and Execution
You can enable secure code execution by configuring the `UserProxyAgent` that allows your agents to write and execute Python code in a controlled environment:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from autogen.coding import LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

# Create a directory to store code files
work_dir = Path("coding")
work_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
code_executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=work_dir)

# Configure the UserProxyAgent with code execution
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
 name="user_proxy",
 code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor}
)
```

#### Tool Integration
You can add tools for your agents to use by creating a function and registering it with the assistant. Here's an example of a weather forecast tool:
```python
from typing import Annotated

def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"):
 """Get the weather for some location"""
 weather_data = {
 "berlin": {"temperature": "13"},
 "istanbul": {"temperature": "40"},
 "san francisco": {"temperature": "55"}
 }
    
 location_lower = location.lower()
 if location_lower in weather_data:
 return json.dumps({
 "location": location.title(),
 "temperature": weather_data[location_lower]["temperature"],
 "unit": unit
 })
 return json.dumps({"location": location, "temperature": "unknown"})

# Register the tool with the assistant
@assistant.register_for_llm(description="Weather forecast for cities.")
def weather_forecast(
 location: Annotated[str, "City name"],
 unit: Annotated[str, "Temperature unit (fahrenheit/celsius)"] = "fahrenheit"
) -> str:
 weather_details = get_current_weather(location=location, unit=unit)
 weather = json.loads(weather_details)
 return f"{weather['location']} will be {weather['temperature']} degrees {weather['unit']}"
```

#### Complete Code Example
Here is our quick start agent code example combined with code execution and tool use that you can play with:
```python
import os
import json
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Annotated
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.coding import LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

# Configure Groq
config_list = [{
 "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
 "api_key": os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY"),
 "api_type": "groq"
}]

# Create a directory to store code files from code executor
work_dir = Path("coding")
work_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
code_executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(work_dir=work_dir)

# Define weather tool
def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"):
 """Get the weather for some location"""
 weather_data = {
 "berlin": {"temperature": "13"},
 "istanbul": {"temperature": "40"},
 "san francisco": {"temperature": "55"}
 }
    
 location_lower = location.lower()
 if location_lower in weather_data:
 return json.dumps({
 "location": location.title(),
 "temperature": weather_data[location_lower]["temperature"],
 "unit": unit
 })
 return json.dumps({"location": location, "temperature": "unknown"})

# Create an AI assistant that uses the weather tool
assistant = AssistantAgent(
 name="groq_assistant",
 system_message="""You are a helpful AI assistant who can:
 - Use weather information tools
 - Write Python code for data visualization
 - Analyze and explain results""",
 llm_config={"config_list": config_list}
)

# Register weather tool with the assistant
@assistant.register_for_llm(description="Weather forecast for cities.")
def weather_forecast(
 location: Annotated[str, "City name"],
 unit: Annotated[str, "Temperature unit (fahrenheit/celsius)"] = "fahrenheit"
) -> str:
 weather_details = get_current_weather(location=location, unit=unit)
 weather = json.loads(weather_details)
 return f"{weather['location']} will be {weather['temperature']} degrees {weather['unit']}"

# Create a user proxy agent that only handles code execution
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
 name="user_proxy",
 code_execution_config={"executor": code_executor}
)

# Start the conversation
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
 assistant,
 message="""Let's do two things:
1. Get the weather for Berlin, Istanbul, and San Francisco
2. Write a Python script to create a bar chart comparing their temperatures"""
)
```

## FAQs

# FAQs

## Understanding Groq Billing Model

### How does Groq's billing cycle work?

Groq uses a monthly billing cycle, but for new users, we also apply progressive billing thresholds to help ease you into pay-as-you-go usage.

### How does Progressive Billing work?

When you first start using Groq on the Developer plan, your billing follows a progressive billing model. In this model, an invoice is automatically triggered and payment is deducted when your cumulative usage reaches specific thresholds: $1, $10, and $100.

 

This helps you monitor early usage and ensures you're not surprised by a large first bill. These are one-time thresholds. Once you cross the $100 lifetime usage threshold, only monthly billing continues.

### What if I don't reach the next threshold?**

If you don't reach the next threshold, your usage will be billed on your regular end-of-month invoice.

 

**Example:**
- You cross $1 → you're charged immediately.
- You then use $2 more for the entire month (lifetime usage = $3, still below $10).
- That $2 will be invoiced at the end of your monthly billing cycle, not immediately.

This ensures you're not repeatedly charged for small amounts and are charged only when hitting a lifetime cumulative threshold or when your billing period ends.

 

Once your lifetime usage crosses the $100 threshold, the progressive thresholds no longer apply. From this point forward, your account is billed solely on a monthly cycle. All future usage is accrued and billed once per month, with payment automatically deducted when the invoice is issued.

### When is payment withdrawn from my account?

Payment is withdrawn automatically from your connected payment method each time an invoice is issued. This can happen in two cases:

- **Progressive billing phase:** When your usage first crosses the $1, $10, or $100 thresholds.
- **Monthly billing phase:** At the end of each monthly billing cycle.

> **Note:** We only bill you once your usage has reached at least $0.50. If you see a total charge of < $0.50 or you get an invoice for < $0.50, there is no action required on your end.

### Can I downgrade to the Free tier after I upgrade?

Yes. You are able to downgrade at any time in your account Settings under [**Billing**](/settings/billing)

> **Note:** When you downgrade, we will issue a final invoice for any outstanding usage not yet billed.

## Monitoring Your Spending & Usage

### How can I view my current usage and spending in real time?

You can monitor your usage and charges in near real-time directly within your Groq Cloud dashboard. Simply navigate to [**Dashboard** → **Usage**](/dashboard/usage)

This dashboard allows you to:
- Track your current usage across models
- Understand how your consumption aligns with pricing per model

### Can I set spending limits or receive budget alerts?

Yes, Groq provides Spend Limits to help you control your API costs. You can set automated spending limits and receive proactive usage alerts as you approach your defined budget thresholds. [**More details here**](/docs/spend-limits)

## Invoices, Billing Info & Credits

### Where can I find my past invoices and payment history?

You can view and download all your invoices and receipts in the Groq Console:
[**Settings** → **Billing** → **Manage Billing**](/settings/billing/manage)

### Can I change my billing info and payment method?

You can update your billing details anytime from the Groq Console:
[**Settings** → **Billing** → **Manage Billing**](/settings/billing/manage)

### What payment methods do you accept?

Groq accepts credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover), United States bank accounts, and SEPA debit accounts as payment methods.

### Are there promotional credits, or trial offers?

Yes! We occasionally offer promotional credits, such as during hackathons and special events. We encourage you to visit our [**Groq Community**](https://community.groq.com/) page to learn more and stay updated on announcements.

 

If you're building a startup, you may be eligible for the [**Groq for Startups**](https://groq.com/groq-for-startups) program, which unlocks $10,000 in credits to help you scale faster.

## Common Billing Questions & Troubleshooting

### How are refunds handled, if applicable?

Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. Due to the specific circumstances involved in each situation, we recommend reaching out directly to our customer support team at **support@groq.com** for assistance. They will review your case and provide guidance.

### What if a user believes there's an error in their bill?

Check your console's Usage and Billing tab first. If you still believe there's an issue:

Please contact our customer support team immediately at **support@groq.com**. They will investigate the specific circumstances of your billing dispute and guide you through the resolution process.

### Under what conditions can my account be suspended due to billing issues?

Account suspension or restriction due to billing issues typically occurs when there's a prolonged period of non-payment or consistently failed payment attempts. However, the exact conditions and resolution process are handled on a case-by-case basis. If your account is impacted, or if you have concerns, please reach out to our customer support team directly at **support@groq.com** for specific guidance regarding your account status.

### What happens if my payment fails? Why did my payment fail?

Failed payments may result in service suspension. We will email you to remind you of your unpaid invoice. To resolve this, you can update your payment method or manually process outstanding payments directly in your account settings.

### What should I do if my billing question isn't answered in the FAQ?

Feel free to contact **support@groq.com**

## FlutterFlow + Groq: Fast & Powerful Cross-Platform Apps

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/flutterflow

## FlutterFlow + Groq: Fast & Powerful Cross-Platform Apps

[**FlutterFlow**](https://flutterflow.io/) is a visual development platform to build high-quality, custom, cross-platform apps. By leveraging Groq's fast AI inference in FlutterFlow, you can build beautiful AI-powered apps to:

- **Build for Scale**: Collaborate efficiently to create robust apps that grow with your needs.
- **Iterate Fast**: Rapidly test, refine, and deploy your app, accelerating your development.
- **Fully Integrate Your Project**: Access databases, APIs, and custom widgets in one place.
- **Deploy Cross-Platform**: Launch on iOS, Android, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### FlutterFlow + Groq Quick Start (10 minutes to hello world)

####1. Securely store your Groq API Key in FlutterFlow as an App State Variable

Go to the App Values tab in the FlutterFlow Builder, add `groqApiKey` as an app state variable, and enter your API key. It should have type `String` and be `persisted` (that way, the API Key is remembered even if you close out of your application).

![*Store your api key securely as an App State variable by selecting "secure persisted fields"*](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_1.png)

*Store your api key securely as an App State variable by selecting "secure persisted fields"*

####2. Create a call to the Groq API

Next, navigate to the API calls tab
Create a new API call, call it `Groq Completion`, set the method type as `POST`, and for the API URL, use: https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions

Now, add the following variables:

- `token` - This is your Groq API key, which you can get from the App Values tab.
- `model` - This is the model you want to use. For this example, we'll use `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`.
- `text` - This is the text you want to send to the Groq API.

![Screenshot2025-02-11 at12.05.22 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_2.png)

####3. Define your API call header

Once you have added the relevant variables, define your API call header. You can reference the token variable you defined by putting it in square brackets ([]).

Define your API call header as follows: `Authorization: Bearer [token]`

![Screenshot2025-02-11 at12.05.38 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_3.png)

####4. Define the body of your API call

You can drag and drop your variables into the JSON body, or include them in angle brackets.

Select JSON, and add the following:
- `model` - This is the model we defined in the variables section.
- `messages` - This is the message you want to send to the Groq API. We need to add the 'text' variable we defined in the variables section within the message within the system-message.

You can modify the system message to fit your specific use-case. We are going to use a generic system message:
"Provide a helpful answer for the following question - text"

![Screenshot2025-02-11 at12.05.49 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_4.png)

####5. Test your API call

By clicking on the “Response & Test” button, you can test your API call. Provide values for your variables, and hit “Test API call” to see the response.

![Screenshot2025-02-11 at12.32.34 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_5.png)

####6. Save relevant JSON Paths of the response

Once you have your API response, you can save relevant JSON Paths of the response.
To save the content of the response from Groq, you can scroll down and click “Add JSON Path” for `$.choices[:].message.content` and provide a name for it, such as “groqResponse”

![Screenshot2025-02-11 at12.34.22 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_6.png)

####7. Connect the API call to your UI with an action

Now that you have added & tested your API call, let’s connect the API call to your UI with an action.

*If you are interested in following along, you can* [**clone the project**](https://app.flutterflow.io/project/groq-documentation-vc2rt1) *and include your own API Key. You can also follow along with this [3-minute video.](https://www.loom.com/share/053ee6ab744e4cf4a5179fac1405a800?sid=4960f7cd-2b29-4538-89bb-51aa5b76946c)*

In this page, we create a simple UI that includes a TextField for a user to input their question, a button to trigger our Groq Completion API call, and a Text widget to display the result from the API. We define a page state variable, groqResult, which will be updated to the result from the API. We then bind the Text widget to our page state variable groqResult, as shown below.

![Screenshot2025-02-25 at3.58.57 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_8.png)

####8. Define an action that calls our API

Now that we have created our UI, we can add an action to our button that will call the API, and update our Text with the API’s response.
To do this, click on the button, open the action editor, and add an action to call the Groq Completion API.

![Screenshot2025-02-25 at4.05.30 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_9.png)

To create our first action to the Groq endpoint, create an action of type Backend API call, and set the "group or call name" to `Groq Completion`.
Then add two additional variables:
- `token` - This is your Groq API key, which you can get from the App State tab.
- `text` - This is the text you want to send to the Groq API, which you can get from the TextField widget.

Finally, rename the action output to `groqResponse`.

![Screenshot2025-02-25 at4.57.28 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_10.png)

####9. Update the page state variable

Once the API call succeeds, we can update our page state variable `groqResult` to the contents of the API response from Groq, using the JSON path we created when defining the API call.

Click on the "+" button for True, and add an action of type "Update Page State".
Add a field for `groqResult`, and set the value to `groqResponse`, found under Action Output.
Select `JSON Body` for the API Response Options, `Predifined Path` Path for the Available Options, and `groqResponse` for the Path.

![Screenshot2025-02-25 at5.03.33 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_11.png)

![Screenshot2025-02-25 at5.03.47 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_12.png)

####10. Run your app in test mode

Now that we have connected our API call to the UI as an action, we can run our app in test mode.

*Watch a [video](https://www.loom.com/share/8f965557a51d43c7ba518280b9c4fd12?sid=006c88e6-a0f2-4c31-bf03-6ba7fc8178a3) of the app live in test mode.*

![Screenshot2025-02-25 at5.37.17 PM.png](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_13.png)

![Result from Test mode session](/showcase-applications/flutterflow/flutterflow_14.png)

## CrewAI + Groq: High-Speed Agent Orchestration

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/crewai

## CrewAI + Groq: High-Speed Agent Orchestration

CrewAI is a framework that enables the orchestration of multiple AI agents with specific roles, tools, and goals as a cohesive team to accomplish complex tasks and create sophisticated workflows.

Agentic workflows require fast inference due to their complexity. Groq's fast inference optimizes response times for CrewAI agent teams, enabling rapid autonomous decision-making and collaboration for:

- **Fast Agent Interactions:** Leverage Groq's fast inference speeds via Groq API for efficient agent communication
- **Reliable Performance:** Consistent response times across agent operations
- **Scalable Multi-Agent Systems:** Run multiple agents in parallel without performance degradation
- **Simple Integration:** Get started with just a few lines of code

### Python Quick Start (2 minutes to hello world)
####1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install crewai groq
```
####2. Configure your Groq API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```
####3. Create your first Groq-powered CrewAI agent:

In CrewAI, **agents** are autonomous entities you can design to perform specific roles and achieve particular goals while **tasks** are specific assignments given to agents that detail the actions they
need to perform to achieve a particular goal. Tools can be assigned as tasks.

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, LLM

# Initialize Large Language Model (LLM) of your choice (see all models on our Models page)
llm = LLM(model="groq/llama-3.1-70b-versatile")

# Create your CrewAI agents with role, main goal/objective, and backstory/personality
summarizer = Agent(
 role='Documentation Summarizer', # Agent's job title/function
 goal='Create concise summaries of technical documentation', # Agent's main objective
 backstory='Technical writer who excels at simplifying complex concepts', # Agent's background/expertise
 llm=llm, # LLM that powers your agent
 verbose=True # Show agent's thought process as it completes its task
)

translator = Agent(
 role='Technical Translator',
 goal='Translate technical documentation to other languages',
 backstory='Technical translator specializing in software documentation',
 llm=llm,
 verbose=True
)

# Define your agents' tasks
summary_task = Task(
 description='Summarize this React hook documentation:\n\nuseFetch(url) is a custom hook for making HTTP requests. It returns { data, loading, error } and automatically handles loading states.',
 expected_output="A clear, concise summary of the hook's functionality",
 agent=summarizer # Agent assigned to task
)

translation_task = Task(
 description='Translate the summary to Turkish',
 expected_output="Turkish translation of the hook documentation",
 agent=translator,
 dependencies=[summary_task] # Must run after the summary task
)

# Create crew to manage agents and task workflow
crew = Crew(
 agents=[summarizer, translator], # Agents to include in your crew
 tasks=[summary_task, translation_task], # Tasks in execution order
 verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

When you run the above code, you'll see that you've created a summarizer agent and a translator agent working together to summarize and translate documentation! This is a simple example to get you started,
but the agents are also able to use tools, which is a powerful combination for building agentic workflows.

**Challenge**: Update the code to add an agent that will write up documentation for functions its given by the user! 


### Advanced Model Configuration
For finer control over your agents' responses, you can easily configure additional model parameters. These settings help you balance between creative and deterministic outputs, control response length, 
and manage token usage:
```python
llm = LLM(
 model="llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
 temperature=0.5,
 max_completion_tokens=1024,
 top_p=0.9,
 stop=None,
 stream=False,
)
```

## Model Migration Guide

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting/model-migration

# Model Migration Guide

Migrating prompts from commercial models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) to open-source ones like Llama often requires explicitly including instructions that might have been implicitly handled in proprietary systems. This migration typically involves adjusting prompting techniques to be more explicit, matching generation parameters, and testing outputs to help with iteratively adjust prompts until the desired outputs are reached.

## Migration Principles

1. **Surface hidden rules:** Proprietary model providers prepend their closed-source models with system messages that are not explicitly shared with the end user; you must create clear system messages to get consistent outputs.
2. **Start from parity, not aspiration:** Match parameters such as temperature, Top P, and max tokens first, then focus on adjusting your prompts.
3. **Automate the feedback loop:** We recommend using open-source tooling like prompt optimizers instead of manual trial-and-error.

## Aligning System Behavior and Tone

Closed-source models are often prepended with elaborate system prompts that enforce politeness, hedging, legal disclaimers, policies, and more, that are not shown to the end user. To ensure consistency and lead open-source models to generate desired outputs, create a comprehensive system prompt.

## Sampling / Parameter Parity

No matter which model you're migrating from, having explicit control over temperature and other sampling parameters matters a lot. First, determine what temperature your source model defaults to (often 1.0). Then experiment to find what works best for your specific use case - many Llama deployments see better results with temperatures between 0.2-0.4. The key is to start with parity, measure the results, then adjust deliberately:

| Parameter | Closed-Source Models | Llama Models | Suggested Adjustments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `temperature` | 1.0 | 0.7 | Lower for factual answers and strict schema adherence (e.g., JSON) |
| `top_p` | 1.0 | 1.0 | leave 1.0 |

## Refactoring Prompts
In some cases, you'll need to refactor your prompts to use explicit [Prompt Patterns](/docs/prompting/patterns) since different models have varying pre- and post-training that can affect how they function. For example:

- Some models, such as [those that can reason](/docs/reasoning), might naturally break down complex problems, while others may need explicit instructions to "think step by step" using [Chain of Thought](/docs/prompting/patterns#chain-of-thought) prompting
- Where some models automatically verify facts, others might need [Chain of Verification](/docs/prompting/patterns#chain-of-verification-cove) to achieve similar accuracy
- When certain models explore multiple solution paths by default, you can achieve similar results with [Self-Consistency](/docs/prompting/patterns#self-consistency) voting across multiple completions

The key is being more explicit about the reasoning process you want. Instead of:

"Calculate the compound interest over 5 years"

Use:

"Let's solve this step by step:
1. First, write out the compound interest formula
2. Then, plug in our values
3. Calculate each year's interest separately
4. Sum the total and verify the math"

This explicit guidance helps open models match the sophisticated reasoning that closed models learn through additional training.

### Migrating from Claude (Anthropic)

Claude models from Anthropic are known for their conversational abilities, safety features, and detailed reasoning. When migrating from Claude to an open-source model like Llama, creating a system prompt with the following instructions to maintain similar behavior:

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Set a clear persona | "I am a helpful, multilingual, and proactive assistant ready to guide this conversation." |
| Specify tone & style | "Be concise and warm. Avoid bullet or numbered lists unless explicitly requested." |
| Limit follow-up questions | "Ask at most one concise clarifying question when needed." |
| Embed reasoning directive | "For tasks that need analysis, think step-by-step in a Thought: section, then provide Answer: only." |
| Insert counting rule | "Enumerate each item with #1, #2 ... before giving totals." |
| Provide a brief accuracy notice | "Information on niche or very recent topics may be incomplete—verify externally." |
| Define refusal template | "If a request breaches guidelines, reply: 'I'm sorry, but I can't help with that.'" |
| Mirror user language | "Respond in the same language the user uses." |
| Reinforce empathy | "Express sympathy when the user shares difficulties; maintain a supportive tone." |
| Control token budget | Keep the final system block under 2,000 tokens to preserve user context. |
| Web search | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in web search. |

### Migrating from Grok (xAI)

Grok models from xAI are known for their conversational abilities, real-time knowledge, and engaging personality. When migrating from Grok to an open-source model like Llama, creating a system prompt with the following instructions to maintain similar behavior:

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Language parity | "Detect the user's language and respond in the same language." |
| Structured style | "Write in short paragraphs; use numbered or bulleted lists for multiple points." |
| Formatting guard | "Do not output Markdown (or only the Markdown elements you permit)." |
| Length ceiling | "Keep the answer below 750 characters" and enforce `max_completion_tokens` in the API call. |
| Epistemic stance | "Adopt a neutral, evidence-seeking tone; challenge unsupported claims; express uncertainty when facts are unclear." |
| Draft-versus-belief rule | "Treat any supplied analysis text as provisional research, not as established fact." |
| No meta-references | "Do not mention the question, system instructions, tool names, or platform branding in the reply." |
| Real-time knowledge | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in web search. |

### Migrating from OpenAI

OpenAI models like GPT-4o are known for their versatility, tool use capabilities, and conversational style. When migrating from OpenAI models to open-source alternatives like Llama, include these key instructions in your system prompt:

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Define a flexible persona | "I am a helpful, adaptive assistant that mirrors your tone and formality throughout our conversation." |
| Add tone-mirroring guidance | "I will adjust my vocabulary, sentence length, and formality to match your style throughout our conversation." |
| Set follow-up-question policy | "When clarification is useful, I'll ask exactly one short follow-up question; otherwise, I'll answer directly." |
| Describe tool-usage rules (if using tools) | "I can use tools like search and code execution when needed, preferring search for factual queries and code execution for computational tasks." |
| State visual-aid preference | "I'll offer diagrams when they enhance understanding" |
| Limit probing | "I won't ask for confirmation after every step unless instructions are ambiguous." |
| Embed safety | "My answers must respect local laws and organizational policies; I'll refuse prohibited content." |
| Web search | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in web search capabilities |
| Code execution | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in code execution capabilities. |
| Tool use | Select a model that supports [tool use](/docs/tool-use). |

### Migrating from Gemini (Google)

When migrating from Gemini to an open-source model like Llama, include these key instructions in your system prompt:

| Instruction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| State the role plainly | Start with one line: "You are a concise, professional assistant." |
| Re-encode rules | Convert every MUST/SHOULD from the original into numbered bullet rules, each should be 1 sentence. |
| Define [tool use](/docs/tool-use) | Add a short Tools section listing tool names and required JSON structure; provide one sample call. |
| Specify tone & length | Include explicit limits (e.g., "less than 150 words unless code is required; formal international English"). |
| Self-check footer | End with "Before sending, ensure JSON validity, correct tag usage, no system text leakage." |
| Content-block guidance | Define how rich output should be grouped: for example, Markdown headings for text, fenced blocks for code. |
| Behaviour checklist | Include numbered, one-sentence rules covering length limits, formatting, and answer structure. |
| Prefer brevity | Remind the model to keep explanations brief and omit library boilerplate unless explicitly requested. |
| Web search and grounding | Use [Agentic Tooling](/docs/agentic-tooling) for built-in web search and grounding capabilities.|

## Tooling: llama-prompt-ops

[**llama-prompt-ops**](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-prompt-ops) auto-rewrites prompts created for GPT / Claude into Llama-optimized phrasing, adjusting spacing, quotes, and special tokens.

Why use it?

- **Drop-in CLI:** feed a JSONL file of prompts and expected responses; get a better prompt with improved success rates.
- **Regression mode:** runs your golden set and reports win/loss vs baseline.

Install once (`pip install llama-prompt-ops`) and run during CI to keep prompts tuned as models evolve.

## Prompt Engineering Patterns Guide

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting/patterns

# Prompt Engineering Patterns Guide

This guide provides a systematic approach to selecting appropriate prompt patterns for various tasks when working with open-source language models. Implementing the correct pattern significantly improves output reliability and performance.

## Why Patterns Matter
Prompt patterns serve distinct purposes in language model interactions:

- **Zero shot** provides instructions without examples, relying on the model's existing knowledge.
- **Few shot** demonstrates specific examples for the model to follow as templates.
- **Chain of Thought** breaks complex reasoning into sequential steps for methodical problem-solving.

Selecting the appropriate pattern significantly improves output accuracy, consistency, and reliability across applications.

## Pattern Chooser Table

The table below helps you quickly identify the most effective prompt pattern for your specific task, matching common use cases with optimal approaches to maximize model performance.

| Task Type | Recommended Pattern | Why it works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simple Q&A, definitions | [**Zero shot**](#zero-shot) | Model already knows; instructions suffice |
| Extraction / classification | [**Few shot (1-3 samples)**](#one-shot--few-shot) | Teaches exact labels & JSON keys |
| Creative writing | [**Zero shot + role**](#zero-shot) | Freedom + persona = coherent style |
| Multi-step math / logic | [**Chain of Thought**](#chain-of-thought) | Forces stepwise reasoning |
| Edge-case heavy tasks | [**Few shot (2-5 samples)**](#one-shot--few-shot) | Covers exceptions & rare labels |

## Customer Support Ticket Processing Use Case

Throughout this guide, we'll use the practical example of automating customer support ticket processing. This enterprise-relevant use case demonstrates how different prompt patterns can improve:
 - Initial ticket triage and categorization
 - Issue urgency assessment
 - Information extraction from customer communications
 - Resolution suggestions and draft responses
 - Ticket summarization for team handoffs

Using AI to enhance support ticket processing can reduce agent workload, accelerate response times, ensure consistent handling, and enable better tracking of common issues. Each prompt pattern offers distinct advantages for specific aspects of the support workflow.

## Zero Shot

Zero shot prompting tells a large-language model **exactly what you want without supplying a single demonstration**. The model leans on the general-purpose knowledge it absorbed during pre-training to infer the right output. You provide instructions but no examples, allowing the model to apply its existing understanding to the task.

### When to use

| Use case | Why Zero Shot works |
| --- | --- |
| **Sentiment classification** | Model has seen millions of examples during training; instructions suffice |
| **Basic information extraction** (e.g., support ticket triage) | Simple extraction of explicit data points requires minimal guidance |
| **Urgent support ticket assessment** | Clear indicators of urgency are typically explicit in customer language |
| **Standard content formatting** | Straightforward style adjustments like formalization or simplification |
| **Language translation** | Well-established task with clear inputs and outputs |
| **Content outlines and summaries** | Follows common structural patterns; benefits from brevity |

### Support Ticket Zero Shot Example

This example demonstrates using zero shot prompting to quickly analyze a customer support ticket for essential information.

## One Shot & Few Shot

A **one shot prompt** includes exactly one worked example; a **few shot prompt** provides several (typically3-8) examples. Both rely on the model's in-context learning to imitate the demonstrated input to output mapping. Because the demonstrations live in the prompt, you get the benefits of "training" without fine-tuning: you can swap tasks or tweak formats instantly by editing examples.

### When to use

| Use case | Why One/Few Shot works |
| --- | --- |
| **Structured output (JSON, SQL, XML)** | Examples nail the exact keys, quoting, or delimiters you need |
| **Support ticket categorization** with nuanced or custom labels | A few examples teach proper categorization schemes specific to your organization |
| **Domain-specific extraction** from technical support tickets | Demonstrations anchor the terminology and extraction patterns |
| **Edge-case handling** for unusual tickets | Show examples of tricky inputs to teach disambiguation strategies |
| **Consistent formatting** of support responses | Examples ensure adherence to company communication standards |
| **Custom urgency criteria** based on business rules | Examples demonstrate how to apply organization-specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) definitions |

### Support Ticket Few Shot Example

This example demonstrates using few shot prompting to extract detailed, structured information from support tickets according to a specific schema.

## Chain of Thought

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompt engineering technique that explicitly instructs the model to think through a problem step-by-step before producing the answer. In its simplest form you add a phrase like **"Let's think step by step."** This cue triggers the model to emit a sequence of reasoning statements (the "chain") followed by a conclusion. Zero shot CoT works effectively on arithmetic and commonsense questions, while few shot CoT supplies handcrafted exemplars for more complex domains.

### When to use

| Problem type | Why CoT helps |
| --- | --- |
| **Math & logic word problems** | Forces explicit arithmetic steps |
| **Multi-hop Q&A / retrieval** | Encourages sequential evidence gathering |
| **Complex support ticket analysis** | Breaks down issue diagnosis into logical components |
| **Content plans & outlines** | Structures longform content creation |
| **Policy / safety analysis** | Documents each step of reasoning for transparency |
| **Ticket priority determination** | Systematically assesses impact, urgency, and SLA considerations |

### Support Ticket Chain of Thought Example

This example demonstrates using CoT to systematically analyze a customer support ticket to extract detailed information and make reasoned judgments about the issue.

## Guided CoT & Self Consistency

Guided CoT provides a structured outline of reasoning steps for the model to follow. Rather than letting the model determine its own reasoning path, you explicitly define the analytical framework.

<br />

Self-Consistency replaces standard decoding in CoT with a sample-and-majority-vote strategy: the same CoT prompt is run multiple times with a higher temperature, the answer from each chain is extracted, then the most common answer is returned as the final result.

### When to use

| Use case | Why it works |
| --- | --- |
| **Support ticket categorization** with complex business rules | Guided CoT ensures consistent application of classification criteria |
| **SLA breach determination** with multiple factors | Self-Consistency reduces calculation errors in deadline computations |
| **Risk assessment** of customer issues | Multiple reasoning paths help identify edge cases in potential impact analysis |
| **Customer sentiment analysis** in ambiguous situations | Consensus across multiple paths provides more reliable interpretation |
| **Root cause analysis** for technical issues | Guided steps ensure thorough investigation across all system components |
| **Draft response generation** for sensitive issues | Self-Consistency helps avoid inappropriate or inadequate responses |

## ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)

ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a prompt pattern that instructs an LLM to generate two interleaved streams:

1. **Thought / reasoning trace** - natural-language reflection on the current state
2. **Action** - a structured command that an external tool executes (e.g., `Search[query]`, `Calculator[expression]`, or `Call_API[args]`) followed by the tool's observation

Because the model can observe the tool's response and continue thinking, it forms a closed feedback loop. The model assesses the situation, takes an action to gather information, processes the results, and repeats if necessary.

### When to use

| Use case | Why ReAct works |
| --- | --- |
| **Support ticket triage requiring contextual knowledge** | Enables lookup of error codes, known issues, and solutions |
| **Ticket analysis needing real-time status checks** | Can verify current system status and outage information |
| **SLA calculation and breach determination** | Performs precise time calculations with Python execution |
| **Customer history-enriched responses** | Retrieves customer context from knowledge bases or documentation |
| **Technical troubleshooting with diagnostic tools** | Runs diagnostic scripts and interprets results |
| **Product-specific error resolution** | Searches documentation and knowledge bases for specific error codes |

## Chain of Verification (CoVe)

Chain of Verification (CoVe) prompting turns the model into its own fact-checker. It follows a four-phase process: first writing a draft analysis, then planning targeted verification questions, answering those questions independently to avoid bias, and finally producing a revised, "verified" response. This technique can reduce error rates significantly across knowledge-heavy tasks while adding only one extra round-trip latency.

### When to use

| Use case | Why CoVe works |
| --- | --- |
| **Support ticket categorization auditing** | Verifies proper categorization through targeted questions |
| **SLA calculation verification** | Double-checks time calculations and policy interpretation |
| **Technical troubleshooting validation** | Confirms logical connections between symptoms and causes |
| **Customer response quality assurance** | Ensures completeness and accuracy of draft responses |
| **Incident impact assessment** | Validates estimates of business impact through specific questions |
| **Error code interpretation** | Cross-checks error code explanations against known documentation |

## Chain of Density (CoD)

Chain of Density (CoD) is an iterative summarization technique that begins with a deliberately entity-sparse draft and progressively adds key entities while maintaining a fixed length. In each round, the model identifies1-3 new entities it hasn't mentioned, then rewrites the summary: compressing existing text to make room for them. After several iterations, the summary achieves a higher entity-per-token density, reducing lead bias and often matching or exceeding human summaries in informativeness.

### When to use

| Use case | Why CoD works |
| --- | --- |
| **Support ticket executive summaries** | Creates highly informative briefs within strict length limits |
| **Agent handover notes** | Ensures all critical details are captured in a concise format |
| **Knowledge base entry creation** | Progressively incorporates technical details without increasing length |
| **Customer communication summaries** | Balances completeness with brevity for customer record notes |
| **SLA/escalation notifications** | Packs essential details into notification character limits |
| **Support team daily digests** | Summarizes multiple tickets with key details for management review |

## Prompt Basics

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prompting

# Prompt Basics

Prompting is the methodology through which we communicate instructions, parameters, and expectations to large language models. Consider a prompt as a detailed specification document provided to the model: the more precise and comprehensive the specifications, the higher the quality of the output. This guide establishes the fundamental principles for crafting effective prompts for open-source instruction-tuned models, including Llama, Deepseek, and Gemma.

## Why Prompts Matter

Large language models require clear direction to produce optimal results. Without precise instructions, they may produce inconsistent outputs. Well-structured prompts provide several benefits:

- **Reduce development time** by minimizing iterations needed for acceptable results.
- **Enhance output consistency** to ensure responses meet validation requirements without modification.
- **Optimize resource usage** by maintaining efficient context window utilization.

## Prompt Building Blocks

Most high-quality prompts contain five elements: **role, instructions, context, input, expected output**.

| Element | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Role** | Sets persona or expertise ("You are a data analyst…") |
| **Instructions** | Bullet-proof list of required actions |
| **Context** | Background knowledge or reference material |
| **Input** | The data or question to transform |
| **Expected Output** | Schema or miniature example to lock formatting |

### Real-world use case

Here's a real-world example demonstrating how these prompt building blocks work together to extract structured data from an email. Each element plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate, consistent output:

1. **System** - fixes the model's role so it doesn't add greetings or extra formatting.
2. **Instructions** - lists the exact keys; pairing this with [JSON mode](/docs/structured-outputs#json-object-mode) or [tool use](/docs/tool-use) further guarantees parseable output.
3. **Context** - gives domain hints ("Deliver to", postcode format) that raise extraction accuracy without extra examples.
4. **Input** - the raw e-mail; keep original line breaks so the model can latch onto visual cues.
5. **Example Output** - a miniature few-shot sample that locks the reply shape to one JSON object.

## Role Channels

Most chat-style APIs expose **three channels**:

| Channel | Typical Use |
| --- | --- |
| `system` | High-level persona & non-negotiable rules ("You are a helpful financial assistant."). |
| `user` | The actual request or data, such as a user's message in a chat. |
| `assistant` | The model's response. In multi-turn conversations, the assistant role can be used to track the conversation history. |

The following example demonstrates how to implement a customer service chatbot using role channels. Role channels provide a structured way for the model to maintain context and generate contextually appropriate responses throughout the conversation.

## Prompt Priming

Prompt priming is the practice of giving the model an **initial block of instructions or context** that influences every downstream token the model generates. Think of it as "setting the temperature of the conversation room" before anyone walks in. This usually lives in the **system** message; in single-shot prompts it's the first paragraph you write. Unlike one- or few-shot demos, priming does not need examples; the power comes from describing roles ("You are a medical billing expert"), constraints ("never reveal PII"), or seed knowledge ("assume the user's database is Postgres16").

### Why it Works

Large language models generate text by conditioning on **all previous tokens**, weighting earlier tokens more heavily than later ones. By positioning high-leverage tokens (role, style, rules) first, priming biases the probability distribution over next tokens toward answers that respect that frame.

### Example (Primed Chat)

## Core Principles

1. **Lead with the must-do.** Put critical instructions first; the model weighs early tokens more heavily.
2. **Show, don't tell.** A one-line schema or table example beats a paragraph of prose.
3. **State limits explicitly.** Use "Return **only** JSON" or "less than75 words" to eliminate chatter.
4. **Use plain verbs.** "Summarize in one bullet per metric" is clearer than "analyze."
5. **Chunk long inputs.** Delimit data with ``` or \<\<\< … \>\>\> so the model sees clear boundaries.

## Context Budgeting

While many models can handle up to **128K** tokens (or more), using a longer system prompt still costs latency and money. While you might be able to fit a lot of information in the model's context window, it could increase latency and reduce the model's accuracy. As a best practice, only include what is needed for the model to generate the desired response in the context.

## Quick Prompting Wins

Try these **10-second tweaks** before adding examples or complex logic:

| Quick Fix | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Add a one-line persona (*"You are a veteran copy editor."*) | Sharper, domain-aware tone |
| Show a mini output sample (one-row table / tiny JSON) | Increased formatting accuracy |
| Use numbered steps in instructions | Reduces answers with extended rambling |
| Add "no extra prose" at the end | Stops model from adding greetings or apologies |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
Review these recommended practices and solutions to avoid common prompting issues.

| Common Mistake | Result | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hidden ask** buried mid-paragraph | Model ignores it | Move all instructions to top bullet list |
| **Over-stuffed context** | Truncated or slow responses | Summarize, remove old examples |
| **Ambiguous verbs** (*"analyze"*) | Vague output | Be explicit (*"Summarize in one bullet per metric"*) |
| **Partial JSON keys** in sample | Model Hallucinates extra keys | Show the **full** schema: even if brief |

## Parameter Tuning
Optimize model outputs by configuring key parameters like temperature and top-p. These settings control the balance between deterministic and creative responses, with recommended values based on your specific use case.

| Parameter | What it does | Safe ranges | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Temperature** | Global randomness (higher = more creative) |0 -1.0 |0 -0.3 facts,0.7 -0.9 creative |
| **Top-p** | Keeps only the top p cumulative probability mass - use this or temperature, not both |0.5 -1.0 |0.9 facts,1.0 creative |
| **Top-k** | Limits to the k highest-probability tokens |20 -100 | Rarely needed; try k =40 for deterministic extraction |

### Quick presets

The following are recommended values to set temperature or top-p to (but not both) for various use cases:

| Scenario | Temp | Top-p | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Factual Q&A |0.2 |0.9 | Keeps dates & numbers stable |
| Data extraction (JSON) |0.0 |0.9 | Deterministic keys/values |
| Creative copywriting |0.8 |1.0 | Vivid language, fresh ideas |
| Brainstorming list |0.7 |0.95 | Variety without nonsense |
| Long-form code |0.3 |0.85 | Fewer hallucinated APIs |

## Controlling Length & Cost

The following are recommended settings for controlling token usage and costs with length limits, stop sequences, and deterministic outputs.

| Setting | Purpose | Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_completion_tokens` | Hard cap on completion size | Set10-20 % above ideal answer length |
| Stop sequences | Early stop when model hits token(s) | Use `"###"` or another delimiter |
| System length hints | "less than75 words" or "return only table rows" | Model respects explicit numbers |
| `seed` | Controls randomness deterministically | Use same seed for consistent outputs across runs |

## Guardrails & Safety

Good prompts set the rules; dedicated guardrail models enforce them. [Meta's **Llama Guard4**](/docs/content-moderation) is designed to sit in front of: or behind: your main model, classifying prompts or outputs for safety violations (hate, self-harm, private data). Integrating a moderation step can cut violation rates without changing your core prompt structure.

## Next Steps

Ready to level up? Explore dedicated [**prompt patterns**](/docs/prompting/patterns) like zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and more to match the pattern to your task complexity. From there, iterate and refine to improve your prompts.

## Text Generation

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/text-chat

# Text Generation

Generating text with Groq's Chat Completions API enables you to have natural, conversational interactions with Groq's large language models. It processes a series of messages and generates human-like responses that can be used for various applications including conversational agents, content generation, task automation, and generating structured data outputs like JSON for your applications.

## Chat Completions

Chat completions allow your applications to have dynamic interactions with Groq's models. You can send messages that include user inputs and system instructions, and receive responses that match the conversational context.
<br />
Chat models can handle both multi-turn discussions (conversations with multiple back-and-forth exchanges) and single-turn tasks where you need just one response.
<br />
For details about all available parameters, [visit the API reference page.](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create)

### Getting Started with Groq SDK

To start using Groq's Chat Completions API, you'll need to install the [Groq SDK](/docs/libraries) and set up your [API key](https://console.groq.com/keys).

## Performing a Basic Chat Completion

The simplest way to use the Chat Completions API is to send a list of messages and receive a single response. Messages are provided in chronological order, with each message containing a role ("system", "user", or "assistant") and content.

## Streaming a Chat Completion

For a more responsive user experience, you can stream the model's response in real-time. This allows your application to display the response as it's being generated, rather than waiting for the complete response.

To enable streaming, set the parameter `stream=True`. The completion function will then return an iterator of completion deltas rather than a single, full completion.

## Performing a Chat Completion with a Stop Sequence

Stop sequences allow you to control where the model should stop generating. When the model encounters any of the specified stop sequences, it will halt generation at that point. This is useful when you need responses to end at specific points.

## Performing an Async Chat Completion

For applications that need to maintain responsiveness while waiting for completions, you can use the asynchronous client. This lets you make non-blocking API calls using Python's asyncio framework.

### Streaming an Async Chat Completion

You can combine the benefits of streaming and asynchronous processing by streaming completions asynchronously. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle multiple concurrent conversations.

## Structured Outputs and JSON

Need reliable, type-safe JSON responses that match your exact schema? Groq's Structured Outputs feature guarantees that model responses strictly conform to your JSON Schema without validation or retry logic.

<br/>

For complete guides on implementing structured outputs with JSON Schema or using JSON Object Mode, see our [structured outputs documentation](/docs/structured-outputs).

<br/>

Key capabilities:
- **JSON Schema enforcement**: Responses match your schema exactly
- **Type-safe outputs**: No validation or retry logic needed
- **Programmatic refusal detection**: Handle safety-based refusals programmatically
- **JSON Object Mode**: Basic JSON output with prompt-guided structure

## Introduction to Tool Use

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/tool-use

# Introduction to Tool Use
Tool use is a powerful feature that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external resources, such as APIs, databases, and the web, to gather dynamic data they wouldn't otherwise have access to in their pre-trained (or static) state and perform actions beyond simple text generation. 
<br />
Tool use bridges the gap between the data that the LLMs were trained on with dynamic data and real-world actions, which opens up a wide array of realtime use cases for us to build powerful applications with, especially with Groq's insanely fast inference speed. 🚀

## Agentic Tooling

In addition to the models that support custom tools above, Groq also offers agentic tool systems. These are AI systems with tools like web search and code execution built directly into the system. You don't need to specify any tools yourself - the system will automatically use its built-in tools as needed.
<br/>

## How Tool Use Works
Groq API tool use structure is compatible with OpenAI's tool use structure, which allows for easy integration. See the following cURL example of a tool use request:
<br />
```bash
curl https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
-d '{
 "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
 "messages": [
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": "What'\''s the weather like in Boston today?"
 }
 ],
 "tools": [
 {
 "type": "function",
 "function": {
 "name": "get_current_weather",
 "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
 "parameters": {
 "type": "object",
 "properties": {
 "location": {
 "type": "string",
 "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
 },
 "unit": {
 "type": "string",
 "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]
 }
 },
 "required": ["location"]
 }
 }
 }
 ],
 "tool_choice": "auto"
}'
```
<br />
To integrate tools with Groq API, follow these steps:
1. Provide tools (or predefined functions) to the LLM for performing actions and accessing external data in real-time in addition to your user prompt within your Groq API request
2. Define how the tools should be used to teach the LLM how to use them effectively (e.g. by defining input and output formats)
3. Let the LLM autonomously decide whether or not the provided tools are needed for a user query by evaluating the user query, determining whether the tools can enhance its response, and utilizing the tools accordingly
4. Extract tool input, execute the tool code, and return results
5. Let the LLM use the tool result to formulate a response to the original prompt

This process allows the LLM to perform tasks such as real-time data retrieval, complex calculations, and external API interaction, all while maintaining a natural conversation with our end user.

## Tool Use with Groq

Groq API endpoints support tool use to almost instantly deliver structured JSON output that can be used to directly invoke functions from desired external resources.

### Tools Specifications
Tool use is part of the [Groq API chat completion request payload](https://console.groq.com/docs/api-reference#chat-create). Groq API tool calls are structured to be OpenAI-compatible.

### Tool Call Structure
The following is an example tool calls structure:
```json
{
 "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
 "messages": [
 {
 "role": "system",
 "content": "You are a weather assistant. Use the get_weather function to retrieve weather information for a given location."
 },
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": "What's the weather like in New York today?"
 }
 ],
 "tools": [
 {
 "type": "function",
 "function": {
 "name": "get_weather",
 "description": "Get the current weather for a location",
 "parameters": {
 "type": "object",
 "properties": {
 "location": {
 "type": "string",
 "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
 },
 "unit": {
 "type": "string",
 "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
 "description": "The unit of temperature to use. Defaults to fahrenheit."
 }
 },
 "required": ["location"]
 }
 }
 }
 ],
 "tool_choice": "auto",
 "max_completion_tokens":4096
}'
```

### Tool Call Response
The following is an example tool calls response based on the above:
```json
"model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
"choices": [{
 "index":0,
 "message": {
 "role": "assistant",
 "tool_calls": [{
 "id": "call_d5wg",
 "type": "function",
 "function": {
 "name": "get_weather",
 "arguments": "{\"location\": \"New York, NY\"}"
 }
 }]
 },
 "logprobs": null,
 "finish_reason": "tool_calls"
}],
```
<br />
When a model decides to use a tool, it returns a response with a `tool_calls` object containing:
- `id`: a unique identifier for the tool call
- `type`: the type of tool call, i.e. function
- `name`: the name of the tool being used
- `parameters`: an object containing the input being passed to the tool

## Setting Up Tools
To get started, let's go through an example of tool use with Groq API that you can use as a base to build more tools on your own.
<br />
#### Step1: Create Tool
Let's install Groq SDK, set up our Groq client, and create a function called `calculate` to evaluate a mathematical expression that we will represent as a tool.
<br />
Note: In this example, we're defining a function as our tool, but your tool can be any function or an external resource (e.g. dabatase, web search engine, external API).

## How to Implement Tool Use

#### Step2: Pass Tool Definition and Messages to Model 
Next, we'll define our `calculate` tool within an array of available `tools` and call our Groq API chat completion. You can read more about tool schema and supported required and optional fields above in [Tool Specifications](#tool-call-and-tool-response-structure).
<br />
By defining our tool, we'll inform our model about what our tool does and have the model decide whether or not to use the tool. We should be as descriptive and specific as possible for our model to be able to make the correct tool use decisions.
<br />
In addition to our `tools` array, we will provide our `messages` array (e.g. containing system prompt, assistant prompt, and/or user prompt). 

#### Step3: Receive and Handle Tool Results
After executing our chat completion, we'll extract our model's response and check for tool calls.
<br />
If the model decides that no tools should be used and does not generate a tool or function call, then the response will be a normal chat completion (i.e. `response_message = response.choices[0].message`) with a direct model reply to the user query. 
<br />
If the model decides that tools should be used and generates a tool or function call, we will:
1. Define available tool or function
2. Add the model's response to the conversation by appending our message
3. Process the tool call and add the tool response to our message
4. Make a second Groq API call with the updated conversation
5. Return the final response

## Parallel Tool Use
We learned about tool use and built single-turn tool use examples above. Now let's take tool use a step further and imagine a workflow where multiple tools can be called simultaneously, enabling more efficient and effective responses.
<br />
This concept is known as **parallel tool use** and is key for building agentic workflows that can deal with complex queries, which is a great example of where inference speed becomes increasingly important (and thankfully we can access fast inference speed with Groq API). 
<br />
Here's an example of parallel tool use with a tool for getting the temperature and the tool for getting the weather condition to show parallel tool use with Groq API in action:

## Error Handling
Groq API tool use is designed to verify whether a model generates a valid tool calls object. When a model fails to generate a valid tool calls object, Groq API will return a400 error with an explanation in the "failed_generation" field of the JSON body that is returned.

### Next Steps
For more information and examples of working with multiple tools in parallel using Groq API and Instructor, see our Groq API Cookbook tutorial [here](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/blob/main/tutorials/parallel-tool-use/parallel-tool-use.ipynb).

<br />

## Tool Use with Structured Outputs (Python)
Groq API offers best-effort matching for parameters, which means the model could occasionally miss parameters or misinterpret types for more complex tool calls. We recommend the [Instuctor](https://python.useinstructor.com/hub/groq/) library to simplify the process of working with structured data and to ensure that the model's output adheres to a predefined schema.
<br />
Here's an example of how to implement tool use using the Instructor library with Groq API:

### Benefits of Using Structured Outputs
- Type Safety: Pydantic models ensure that output adheres to the expected structure, reducing the risk of errors.
- Automatic Validation: Instructor automatically validates the model's output against the defined schema.

### Next Steps
For more information and examples of working with structured outputs using Groq API and Instructor, see our Groq API Cookbook tutorial [here](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/blob/main/tutorials/structured-output-instructor/structured_output_instructor.ipynb).

## Streaming Tool Use
The Groq API also offers streaming tool use, where you can stream tool use results to the client as they are generated.

```python
from groq import Groq
import json

client = Groq()

async def main():
 stream = await client.chat.completions.create(
 messages=[
 {
 "role": "system",
 "content": "You are a helpful assistant.",
 },
 {
 "role": "user",
 # We first ask it to write a Poem, to show the case where there's text output before function calls, since that is also supported
 "content": "What is the weather in San Francisco and in Tokyo? First write a short poem.",
 },
 ],
 tools=[
 {
 "type": "function",
 "function": {
 "name": "get_current_weather",
 "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
 "parameters": {
 "type": "object",
 "properties": {
 "location": {
 "type": "string",
 "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
 },
 "unit": {
 "type": "string",
 "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]
 }
 },
 "required": ["location"]
 }
 }
 }
 ],
 model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
 temperature=0.5,
 stream=True
 )

 async for chunk in stream:
 print(json.dumps(chunk.model_dump()) + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
 import asyncio
 asyncio.run(main())
```

## Best Practices

- Provide detailed tool descriptions for optimal performance.
- We recommend tool use with the Instructor library for structured outputs.
- Use the fine-tuned Llama3 models by Groq or the Llama3.1 models for your applications that require tool use.
- Implement a routing system when using fine-tuned models in your workflow.
- Handle tool execution errors by returning error messages with `"is_error": true`.

## Browser Search

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/browser-search

# Browser Search

Some models on Groq have built-in support for interactive browser search, providing a more comprehensive approach to accessing real-time web content than traditional web search. Unlike [Web Search](/docs/web-search) which performs a single search and retrieves text snippets from webpages, Browser Search mimics human browsing behavior by navigating websites interactively, providing more detailed results.

## Supported Models

Built-in browser search is supported for the following models:

| Model ID | Model |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| openai/gpt-oss-20b | [OpenAI GPT-OSS20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)
| openai/gpt-oss-120b | [OpenAI GPT-OSS120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)


## Quick Start

To use browser search, change the `model` parameter to one of the supported models.

When the API is called, it will use browser search to best answer the user's query. This tool call is performed on the server side, so no additional setup is required on your part to use this feature.

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing snippets from the web pages that were searched, and the final response at the end. The model combines information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive response.

<br />

## Pricing

Browser search is currently available at **no additional charge** for supported models. Pricing may be updated in the future as this feature moves beyond beta availability.

Please see the [Pricing](https://groq.com/pricing) page for more information.

## Best Practices

When using browser search with reasoning models, consider setting `reasoning_effort` to `low` to optimize performance and token usage. Higher reasoning effort levels can result in extended browser sessions with more comprehensive web exploration, which may consume significantly more tokens than necessary for most queries. Using `low` reasoning effort provides a good balance between search quality and efficiency.


## Limitations

- Citations are currently not returned from browser search - we're working on it!

## Provider Information

Browser search functionality is powered by [Exa](https://exa.ai/), a search engine designed for AI applications. Exa provides comprehensive web browsing capabilities that go beyond traditional search by allowing models to navigate and interact with web content in a more human-like manner.

By organizing your work into projects, you can isolate workloads to gain granular control over resources, costs, access permissions, and usage tracking on a per-project basis.

## Why Use Projects?
- **Isolation and Organization:** Projects create logical boundaries between different applications, environments (development, staging, production), and use cases. This prevents resource conflicts and enables clear separation of concerns across your organization.
- **Cost Control and Visibility:** Track spending, usage patterns, and resource consumption at the project level. This granular visibility enables accurate cost allocation, budget management, and ROI analysis for specific initiatives.
- **Team Collaboration:** Control who can access what resources through project-based permissions. Teams can work independently within their projects while maintaining organizational oversight and governance.
- **Operational Excellence:** Configure rate limits, monitor performance, and debug issues at the project level. This enables optimized resource allocation and simplified troubleshooting workflows.

## Project Structure
Projects inherit settings and permissions from your organization while allowing project-specific customization. Your organization-level role determines your maximum permissions within any project.

Each project acts as an isolated workspace containing:

- **API Keys:** Project-specific credentials for secure access
- **Rate Limits:** Customizable quotas for each available model
- **Usage Data:** Consumption metrics, costs, and request logs
- **Team Access:** Role-based permissions for project members

The following are the roles that are inherited from your organization along with their permissions within a project:

- **Owner:** Full access to creating, updating, and deleting projects, modifying limits for models within projects, managing API keys, viewing usage and spending data across all projects, and managing project access.
- **Developer:** Currently same as Owner.
- **Reader:** Read-only access to projects and usage metrics, logs, and spending data.

## Getting Started
### Creating Your First Project
**1. Access Projects**: Navigate to the **Projects** section at the top lefthand side of the Console. You will see a dropdown that looks like **Organization** / **Projects**.
<br />
**2. Create Project:** Click the rightside **Projects** dropdown and click **Create Project** to create a new project by inputting a project name. You will also notice that there is an option to **Manage Projects** that will be useful later.
 > 
 > **Note:** Create separate projects for development, staging, and production environments, and use descriptive, consistent naming conventions (e.g. "myapp-dev", "myapp-staging", "myapp-prod") to avoid conflicts and maintain clear project boundaries.
 > 
<br />
**3. Configure Settings**: Once you create a project, you will be able to see it in the dropdown and under **Manage Projects**. Click **Manage Projects** and click **View** to customize project rate limits.
>
> **Note:** Start with conservative limits for new projects, increase limits based on actual usage patterns and needs, and monitor usage regularly to adjust as needed.
>
<br />
**4. Generate API Keys:** Once you've configured your project and selected it in the dropdown, it will persist across the console. Any API keys generated will be specific to the project you have selected. Any logs will also be project-specific.
<br />
**5. Start Building:** Begin making API calls using your project-specific API credentials

### Project Selection
Use the project selector in the top navigation to switch between projects. All Console sections automatically filter to show data for the selected project:
- API Keys
- Batch Jobs
- Logs and Usage Analytics

## Rate Limit Management
### Understanding Rate Limits
Rate limits control the maximum number of requests your project can make to models within a specific time window. Rate limits are applied per project, meaning each project has its own separate quota that doesn't interfere with other projects in your organization.
Each project can be configured to have custom rate limits for every available model, which allows you to:

- Allocate higher limits to production projects
- Set conservative limits for experimental or development projects
- Customize limits based on specific use case requirements

Custom project rate limits can only be set to values equal to or lower than your organization's limits. Setting a custom rate limit for a project does not increase your organization's overall limits, it only allows you to set more restrictive limits for that specific project. Organization limits always take precedence and act as a ceiling for all project limits.

### Configuring Rate Limits
To configure rate limits for a project:
1. Navigate to **Projects** in your settings
2. Select the project you want to configure
3. Adjust the limits for each model as needed

### Example: Rate Limits Across Projects

Let's say you've created three projects for your application:
- myapp-prod for production
- myapp-staging for testing
- myapp-dev for development

**Scenario:**

- Organization Limit:100 requests per minute
- myapp-prod:80 requests per minute
- myapp-staging:30 requests per minute
- myapp-dev: Using default organization limits


**Here's how the rate limits work in practice:**

1. myapp-prod
 - Can make up to80 requests per minute (custom project limit)
 - Even if other projects are idle, cannot exceed80 requests per minute
 - Contributing to the organization's total limit of100 requests per minute

2. myapp-staging
 - Limited to30 requests per minute (custom project limit)
 - Cannot exceed this limit even if organization has capacity
 - Contributing to the organization's total limit of100 requests per minute

3. myapp-dev
 - Inherits the organization limit of100 requests per minute
 - Actual available capacity depends on usage from other projects
 - If myapp-prod is using80 requests/min and myapp-staging is using15 requests/min, myapp-dev can only use5 requests/min

**What happens during high concurrent usage:**

If both myapp-prod and myapp-staging try to use their maximum configured limits simultaneously:
- myapp-prod attempts to use80 requests/min
- myapp-staging attempts to use30 requests/min
- Total attempted usage:110 requests/min
- Organization limit:100 requests/min

In this case, some requests will fail with rate limit errors because the combined usage exceeds the organization's limit. Even though each project is within its configured limits, the organization limit of100 requests/min acts as a hard ceiling. 

## Usage Tracking
Projects provide comprehensive usage tracking including:

- Monthly spend tracking: Monitor costs and spending patterns for each project
- Usage metrics: Track API calls, token usage, and request patterns
- Request logs: Access detailed logs for debugging and monitoring

Dashboard pages will automatically be filtered by your selected project. Access these insights by:

1. Selecting your project in the top left of the navigation bar
2. Navigate to the **Dashboard** to see your project-specific **Usage**, **Metrics**, and **Logs** pages

## Next Steps

- **Explore** the [Rate Limits](/docs/rate-limits) documentation for detailed rate limit configuration
- **Learn** about [Groq Libraries](/docs/libraries) to integrate Projects into your applications
- **Join** our [developer community](https://community.groq.com) for Projects tips and best practices

## Spend Limits

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/spend-limits

# Spend Limits

Control your API costs with automated spending limits and proactive usage alerts when approaching budget thresholds.

## Quick Start

**Set a spending limit in 3 steps:**
1. Go to [**Settings** → **Billing** → **Limits**](/settings/billing/limits)
2. Click **Add Limit** and enter your monthly budget in USD
3. Add alert thresholds at 50%, 75%, and 90% of your limit
4. Click **Save** to activate the limit

**Requirements:** Paid tier account with organization owner permissions.

## How It Works

Spend limits automatically protect your budget by blocking API access when you reach your monthly cap. The limit applies organization-wide across all API keys, so usage from any team member or application counts toward the same shared limit. If you hit your set limit, API calls from any key in your organization will return a 400 with code `blocked_api_access`. Usage alerts notify you via email before you hit the limit, giving you time to adjust usage or increase your budget.

This feature offers:

- **Near real-time tracking:** Your current spend updates every 10-15 minutes  
- **Automatic monthly reset:** Limits reset at the beginning of each billing cycle (1st of the month)  
- **Immediate blocking:** API access is blocked when a spend update detects you've hit your limit

> ⚠️ **Important:** There's a 10-15 minute delay in spend tracking. This means you might exceed your limit by a small amount during high usage periods.

## Setting Up Spending Limits

### Create a Spending Limit

Navigate to [**Settings** → **Billing** → **Limits**](/settings/billing/limits) and click **Add Limit**.

Example Monthly Spending Limit: $500

Your API requests will be blocked when you reach $500 in monthly usage. The limit resets automatically on the 1st of each month.

### Add Usage Alerts

Set up email notifications before you hit your limit:
Alert at $250 (50% of limit)
Alert at $375 (75% of limit)
Alert at $450 (90% of limit)

**To add an alert:**
1. Click **Add Alert** in the Usage Alerts section
2. Enter the USD amount trigger
3. Click **Save**

Alerts appear as visual markers on your spending progress bar on Groq Console Limits page under Billing.

### Manage Your Alerts

- **Edit Limit:** Click the pencil icon next to any alert
- **Delete:** Click the trash icon to remove an alert
- **Multiple alerts:** Add as many thresholds as needed

## Email Notifications

All spending alerts and limit notifications are sent from **support@groq.com** to your billing email addresses.

**Update billing emails:**
1. Go to [**Settings** → **Billing** → **Manage**](/settings/billing)
2. Add or update email addresses
3. Return to the Limits page to confirm the changes

**Pro tip:** Add multiple team members to billing emails so important notifications don't get missed.

## Best Practices

### Setting Effective Limits

- **Start conservative:** Set your first limit 20-30% above your expected monthly usage to account for variability.

- **Monitor patterns:** Review your usage for 2-3 months, then adjust limits based on actual consumption patterns.

- **Leave buffer room:** Don't set limits exactly at your expected usage—unexpected spikes can block critical API access.

- **Use multiple thresholds:** Set alerts at 50%, 75%, and 90% of your limit to get progressive warnings.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access the Limits Page?

- **Check your account tier:** Spending limits are only available on paid plans, not free tier accounts.

- **Verify permissions:** You need organization owner permissions to manage spending limits.

- **Feature availability:** Contact us via support@groq.com if you're on a paid tier but don't see the spending limits feature.

### Not Receiving Alert Emails?

- **Verify email addresses:** Check that your billing emails are correct in [**Settings** → **Billing** → **Manage**](/settings/billing).

- **Check spam folders:** Billing alerts might be filtered by your email provider.

- **Test notifications:** Set a low-dollar test alert to verify email delivery is working.

### API Access Blocked?

- **Check your spending status:** The [limits page](/settings/billing/limits) shows your current spend against your limit.

- **Increase your limit:** You can raise your spending limit at any time to restore immediate access if you've hit your spend limit. You can also remove it to unblock your API access immediately.

- **Wait for reset:** If you've hit your limit, API access will restore on the 1st of the next month.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I set different limits for different API endpoints or API keys?**  
A: No, spending limits are organization-wide and apply to your total monthly usage across all API endpoints and all API keys in your organization. All team members and applications using your organization's API keys share the same spending limit.

**Q: What happens to in-flight requests when I hit my limit?**  
A: In-flight requests complete normally, but new requests are blocked immediately.

**Q: Can I set weekly or daily spending limits?**  
A: Currently, only monthly limits are supported. Limits reset on the 1st of each month.

**Q: How accurate is the spending tracking?**  
A: Spending is tracked in near real-time with a 10-15 minute delay. The delay prevents brief usage spikes from prematurely triggering limits.

**Q: Can I temporarily disable my spending limit?**  
A: Yes, you can edit or remove your spending limit at any time from the limits page.

## MLflow + Groq: Open-Source GenAI Observability

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/mlflow

## MLflow + Groq: Open-Source GenAI Observability

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is an open-source platform developed by Databricks to assist in building better Generative AI (GenAI) applications.

MLflow provides a tracing feature that enhances model observability in your GenAI applications by capturing detailed information about the requests 
you make to the models within your applications. Tracing provides a way to record the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each 
intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.

The MLflow integration with Groq includes the following features:
- **Tracing Dashboards**: Monitor your interactions with models via Groq API with dashboards that include inputs, outputs, and metadata of spans
- **Automated Tracing**: A fully automated integration with Groq, which can be enabled by running `mlflow.groq.autolog()`
- **Easy Manual Trace Instrumentation**: Customize trace instrumentation through MLflow's high-level fluent APIs such as decorators, function wrappers and context managers
- **OpenTelemetry Compatibility**: MLflow Tracing supports exporting traces to an OpenTelemetry Collector, which can then be used to export traces to various backends such as Jaeger, Zipkin, and AWS X-Ray
- **Package and Deploy Agents**: Package and deploy your agents with Groq LLMs to an inference server with a variety of deployment targets
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate your agents using Groq LLMs with a wide range of metrics using a convenient API called `mlflow.evaluate()`

## Python Quick Start (2 minutes to hello world)

###1. Install the required packages:
```python
# The Groq integration is available in mlflow >=2.20.0
pip install mlflow groq
```
###2. Configure your Groq API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

###3. (Optional) Start your mlflow server
```bash
# This process is optional, but it is recommended to use MLflow tracking server for better visualization and additional features
mlflow server
```
###4. Create your first traced Groq application:

Let's enable MLflow auto-tracing with the Groq SDK. For more configurations, refer to the [documentation for `mlflow.groq`](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.groq.html).
```python
import mlflow
import groq

# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment name if you have a tracking server
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")
mlflow.set_experiment("Groq")

# Turn on auto tracing for Groq by calling mlflow.groq.autolog()

client = groq.Groq()

# Use the create method to create new message
message = client.chat.completions.create(
 model="qwen-2.5-32b",
 messages=[
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": "Explain the importance of low latency LLMs.",
 }
 ],
)

print(message.choices[0].message.content)
```

###5. Visualize model usage on the MLflow tracing dashboard:

Now traces for your Groq usage are captured by MLflow! Let's get insights into our application's activities by visiting the MLflow tracking server
we set in Step4 above (`mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")`), which we can do by opening http://localhost:5000 in our browser.

## E2B + Groq: Open-Source Code Interpreter

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/e2b

## E2B + Groq: Open-Source Code Interpreter

[E2B](https://e2b.dev/) Code Interpreter is an open-source SDK that provides secure, sandboxed environments for executing code generated by LLMs via Groq API. Built specifically for AI data analysts, 
coding applications, and reasoning-heavy agents, E2B enables you to both generate and execute code in a secure sandbox environment in real-time.

### Python Quick Start (3 minutes to hello world)

####1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install groq e2b-code-interpreter python-dotenv
```

####2. Configure your Groq and [E2B](https://e2b.dev/docs) API keys:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
export E2B_API_KEY="your-e2b-api-key"
```

####3. Create your first simple and fast Code Interpreter application that generates and executes code to analyze data:

Running the below code will create a secure sandbox environment, generate Python code using `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` powered by Groq, execute the code, and display the results. When you go to your 
[E2B Dashboard](https://e2b.dev/dashboard), you'll see your sandbox's data. 

```python
from e2b_code_interpreter import Sandbox
from groq import Groq
import os

e2b_api_key = os.environ.get('E2B_API_KEY')
groq_api_key = os.environ.get('GROQ_API_KEY')

# Initialize Groq client
client = Groq(api_key=groq_api_key)

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a Python data scientist. Generate simple code that:
1. Uses numpy to generate5 random numbers
2. Prints only the mean and standard deviation in a clean format
Example output format:
Mean:5.2
Std Dev:1.8"""

def main():
 # Create sandbox instance (by default, sandbox instances stay alive for5 mins)
 sbx = Sandbox()
    
 # Get code from Groq
 response = client.chat.completions.create(
 model="llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
 messages=[
 {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
 {"role": "user", "content": "Generate random numbers and show their mean and standard deviation"}
 ]
 )
    
 # Extract and run the code
 code = response.choices[0].message.content
 if "```python" in code:
 code = code.split("```python")[1].split("```")[0]
    
 print("\nGenerated Python code:")
 print(code)
    
 print("\nExecuting code in sandbox...")
 execution = sbx.run_code(code)
 print(execution.logs.stdout[0])
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
 main()
```

**Challenge**: Try modifying the example to analyze your own dataset or solve a different data science problem!

## Responses API

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/responses-api

# Responses API

Groq's Responses API is fully compatible with OpenAI's Responses API, making it easy to integrate advanced conversational AI capabilities into your applications. The Responses API supports both text and image inputs while producing text outputs, stateful conversations, and function calling to connect with external systems.

The Responses API is currently in beta. Please let us know your feedback in our [Community](https://community.groq.com).

## Configuring OpenAI Client for Responses API

To use the Responses API with OpenAI's client libraries, configure your client with your Groq API key and set the base URL to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`:

You can find your API key [here](/keys).

## Unsupported Features

Although Groq's Responses API is mostly compatible with OpenAI's Responses API, there are a few features we don't support just yet:

- `previous_response_id`
- `store`
- `truncation`
- `include`
- `reasoning` (including both reasoning settings and reasoning response from the model)
- `safety_identifier`
- `prompt_cache_key`

## Built-In Tools

In addition to a model's regular [tool use capabilities](/docs/tool-use), the Responses API supports various built-in tools to extend your model's capabilities.

### Model Support

While all models support the Responses API, these built-in tools are only supported for the following models:


| Model ID | [Browser Search](/docs/browser-search) | [Code Execution](/docs/code-execution) |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| [openai/gpt-oss-20b](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)| ✅ | ✅ |
| [openai/gpt-oss-120b](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b) | ✅ | ✅ |


<br />

Here are examples using code execution and browser search:

### Code Execution Example

Enable your models to write and execute Python code for calculations, data analysis, and problem-solving - see our [code execution documentation](/docs/code-execution) for more details.

### Browser Search Example

Give your models access to real-time web content and up-to-date information - see our [browser search documentation](/docs/browser-search) for more details.

## Structured Outputs

Use structured outputs to ensure the model's response follows a specific JSON schema. This is useful for extracting structured data from text, ensuring consistent response formats, or integrating with downstream systems that expect specific data structures.

<br />

For a complete list of models that support structured outputs, see our [structured outputs documentation](/docs/structured-outputs).

## Using third-party libraries and SDKs

### Using AI SDK:

[AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) is a Javascript-based open-source library that simplifies building large language model (LLM) applications. Documentation for how to use Groq on the AI SDK [can be found here](https://console.groq.com/docs/ai-sdk/).

<br />

First, install the `ai` package and the Groq provider `@ai-sdk/groq`:

<br />

```shell
pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/groq
```

<br />

Then, you can use the Groq provider to generate text. By default, the provider will look for `GROQ_API_KEY` as the API key.

<br />

```js
const { text } = await generateText({
 model: groq('llama-3.3-70b-versatile'),
 prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for4 people.',
});
```

### Using LiteLLM:

[LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) is both a Python-based open-source library, and a proxy/gateway server that simplifies building large language model (LLM) applications. Documentation for LiteLLM [can be found here](https://docs.litellm.ai/).

<br />

First, install the `litellm` package:

<br />

```python
pip install litellm

```

<br />

Then, set up your API key:

<br />

```python
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"

```

<br />

Now you can easily use any model from Groq. Just set `model=groq/<any-model-on-groq>` as a prefix when sending litellm requests.

<br />

```python
from litellm import completion
import os

os.environ['GROQ_API_KEY'] = ""
response = completion(
 model="groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile", 
 messages=[
 {"role": "user", "content": "hello from litellm"}
 ],
)
print(response)
```

### Using LangChain:

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a framework for developing reliable agents and applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Documentation for LangChain [can be found here for Python](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/), and [here for Javascript](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction/).

<br />

When using Python, first, install the `langchain` package:

<br />

```python
pip install langchain-groq

```

<br />

Then, set up your API key:

<br />

```python
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"

```

<br />

Now you can build chains and agents that can perform multi-step tasks. This chain combines a prompt that tells the model what information to extract, a parser that ensures the output follows a specific JSON format, and llama-3.3-70b-versatile to do the actual text processing.

<br />

```python
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser
import json

# Initialize Groq LLM
llm = ChatGroq(
 model_name="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
 temperature=0.7
)

# Define the expected JSON structure
parser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object={
 "type": "object",
 "properties": {
 "name": {"type": "string"},
 "price": {"type": "number"},
 "features": {
 "type": "array",
 "items": {"type": "string"}
 }
 }
})

# Create a simple prompt
prompt = ChatPromptPromptTemplate.from_messages([
 ("system", """Extract product details into JSON with this structure:
 {{
 "name": "product name here",
 "price": number_here_without_currency_symbol,
 "features": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"]
 }}"""),
 ("user", "{input}")
])

# Create the chain that guarantees JSON output
chain = prompt | llm | parser

def parse_product(description: str) -> dict:
 result = chain.invoke({"input": description})
 print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))

        
# Example usage
description = """The Kees Van Der Westen Speedster is a high-end, single-group espresso machine known for its precision, performance, 
and industrial design. Handcrafted in the Netherlands, it features dual boilers for brewing and steaming, PID temperature control for 
consistency, and a unique pre-infusion system to enhance flavor extraction. Designed for enthusiasts and professionals, it offers 
customizable aesthetics, exceptional thermal stability, and intuitive operation via a lever system. The pricing is approximatelyt $14,499 
depending on the retailer and customization options."""

parse_product(description)

```

Now that you have successfully received a chat completion, you can try out the other endpoints in the API.

## 🦜️🔗 LangChain + Groq

While you could use the Groq SDK directly, [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a framework that makes it easy to build sophisticated applications 
with LLMs. Combined with Groq API for fast inference speed, you can leverage LangChain components such as:

- **Chains:** Compose multiple operations into a single workflow, connecting LLM calls, prompts, and tools together seamlessly (e.g., prompt → LLM → output parser)
- **Prompt Templates:** Easily manage your prompts and templates with pre-built structures to consisently format queries that can be reused across different models
- **Memory:** Add state to your applications by storing and retrieving conversation history and context 
- **Tools:** Extend your LLM applications with external capabilities like calculations, external APIs, or data retrievals
- **Agents:** Create autonomous systems that can decide which tools to use and how to approach complex tasks

### Quick Start (3 minutes to hello world)

####1. Install the package:
```bash
pip install langchain-groq
```

####2. Set up your API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

####3. Create your first LangChain assistant:

Running the below code will create a simple chain that calls a model to extract product information from text and output it
as structured JSON. The chain combines a prompt that tells the model what information to extract, a parser that ensures the output follows a 
specific JSON format, and `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` to do the actual text processing.

```python
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser
import json

# Initialize Groq LLM
llm = ChatGroq(
 model_name="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
 temperature=0.7
)

# Define the expected JSON structure
parser = JsonOutputParser(pydantic_object={
 "type": "object",
 "properties": {
 "name": {"type": "string"},
 "price": {"type": "number"},
 "features": {
 "type": "array",
 "items": {"type": "string"}
 }
 }
})

# Create a simple prompt
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
 ("system", """Extract product details into JSON with this structure:
 {{
 "name": "product name here",
 "price": number_here_without_currency_symbol,
 "features": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"]

## Content Moderation

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/content-moderation

# Content Moderation

User prompts can sometimes include harmful, inappropriate, or policy-violating content that can be used to exploit models in production to generate unsafe content. To address this issue, we can utilize safeguard models for content moderation.

<br />

Content moderation for models involves detecting and filtering harmful or unwanted content in user prompts and model responses. This is essential to ensure safe and responsible use of models. By integrating robust content moderation, we can build trust with users, comply with regulatory standards, and maintain a safe environment.

<br/>

Groq offers [**Llama Guard4**](/docs/model/llama-guard-4-12b) for content moderation, a12B parameter multimodal model developed by Meta that takes text and image as input.

## Llama Guard4
Llama Guard4 is a natively multimodal safeguard model that is designed to process and classify content in both model inputs (prompt classification) and model responses (response classification) for both text and images, making it capable of content moderation across multiple formats. When used, Llama Guard4 generates text output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe. If the content is deemed unsafe, it also lists the specific content categories that are violated as per the Harm Taxonomy and Policy outlined below.

<br />
Llama Guard4 applies a probability-based approach to produce classifier scores. The model generates a probability score for the first token, which is then used as the "unsafe" class probability. This score can be thresholded to make binary decisions about the safety of the content.
<br />

<figure>
 <img src="/content-moderation/llamaguard3-example.png" alt="Figure1" />
 <figcaption className='text-xs'>Figure1: Illustration of task instructions used by Llama Guard for assessing the safety of conversational prompts and responses. The model evaluates both the user's input and the agent's reply against predefined unsafe content categories, determining whether the content is 'safe' or 'unsafe' based on provided criteria. [1]</figcaption>
</figure>

<br />

## Usage

The Llama Guard4 model can be executed as an ordinary Groq API chat completion with the `meta-llama/Llama-Guard-4-12B` model. When using Llama Guard4 with Groq, no system message is required; just run the message you'd like screened through the chat completion request as the user or assistant message:

<br />


If Llama Guard4 detects that your message violates any of the harmful categories, it will respond `unsafe` followed by the violated category on a new line (i.e. `unsafe\nS2`). If your message is safe, it will simply respond `safe`.

<br />

Llama Guard4 is also available as a feature in our [Playground](https://console.groq.com/playground) under Advanced parameters:

<img src="/content-moderation/llamaguard3-playground.png" alt="Alt text" style={{ width: '300px' }} />


<br />

## Harm Taxonomy and Policy

Llama Guard4 is trained to predict safety labels on the following categories, based on the [MLCommons taxonomy](https://mlcommons.org/2024/04/mlc-aisafety-v0-5-poc/) of hazards. (Note: The taxonomy may have been updated for Llama Guard4; please refer to the [Meta Llama Guard4 documentation](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/) for the most current list.)

## Reasoning

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/reasoning

# Reasoning 
Reasoning models excel at complex problem-solving tasks that require step-by-step analysis, logical deduction, and structured thinking and solution validation. With Groq inference speed, these types of models 
can deliver instant reasoning capabilities critical for real-time applications. 

## Why Speed Matters for Reasoning
Reasoning models are capable of complex decision making with explicit reasoning chains that are part of the token output and used for decision-making, which make low-latency and fast inference essential. 
Complex problems often require multiple chains of reasoning tokens where each step build on previous results. Low latency compounds benefits across reasoning chains and shaves off minutes of reasoning to a response in seconds. 

## Supported Models

| Model ID | Model |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `openai/gpt-oss-20b` | [OpenAI GPT-OSS20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)
| `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | [OpenAI GPT-OSS120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)
| `qwen/qwen3-32b` | [Qwen332B](/docs/model/qwen3-32b)
| `deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b` | [DeepSeek R1 Distil Llama70B](/docs/model/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b) |

## Reasoning Format
Groq API supports explicit reasoning formats through the `reasoning_format` parameter, giving you fine-grained control over how the model's 
reasoning process is presented. This is particularly valuable for valid JSON outputs, debugging, and understanding the model's decision-making process.

<br />

This option is not supported for `openai/gpt-oss-20b` and `openai/gpt-oss-120b`.
The reasoning format is always `parsed` for these models and its reasoning will be in the `reasoning` field of the assistant response.

<br />

**Note:** The format defaults to `raw` or `parsed` when JSON mode or tool use are enabled as those modes do not support `raw`. If reasoning is 
explicitly set to `raw` with JSON mode or tool use enabled, we will return a400 error.

### Options for Reasoning Format
| `reasoning_format` Options | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `parsed` | Separates reasoning into a dedicated `message.reasoning` field while keeping the response concise. |
| `raw` | Includes reasoning within `<think>` tags in the main text content. |
| `hidden` | Returns only the final answer. | 

## Reasoning Effort

### Options for Reasoning Effort (GPT-OSS)

The `reasoning_effort` parameter controls the level of effort the model will put into reasoning. This is only supported by [GPT-OSS20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b) and [GPT-OSS120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b).

| `reasoning_effort` Options | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `low` | Low effort reasoning. The model will use a small number of reasoning tokens. |
| `medium` | Medium effort reasoning. The model will use a moderate number of reasoning tokens. |
| `high` | High effort reasoning. The model will use a large number of reasoning tokens. |

### Options for Reasoning Effort (Qwen332B)

The `reasoning_effort` parameter controls the level of effort the model will put into reasoning. This is only supported by [Qwen332B](/docs/model/qwen3-32b).

| `reasoning_effort` Options | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------| 
| `none` | Disable reasoning. The model will not use any reasoning tokens. |
| `default` | Enable reasoning. |


## Quick Start

Get started with reasoning models using this basic example that demonstrates how to make a simple API call for complex problem-solving tasks.

```bash
curl https://api.groq.com//openai/v1/chat/completions -s \
 -H "authorization: bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
 -d '{
 "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b",
 "messages": [
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"
 }
 ]
 }'
```

## Quick Start with Tool Use

This example shows how to combine reasoning models with function calling to create intelligent agents that can perform actions while explaining their thought process.

```bash
curl https://api.groq.com//openai/v1/chat/completions -s \
 -H "authorization: bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
 -d '{
 "model": "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b",
 "messages": [
 {
 "role": "user",
 "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"
 }
 ],
 "tools": [
 {
 "type": "function",
 "function": {
 "name": "get_weather",
 "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
 "parameters": {
 "type": "object",
 "properties": {
 "location": {
 "type": "string",
 "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
 }
 },
 "required": [
 "location"
 ],
 "additionalProperties": false
 },
 "strict": true
 }
 }
 ]}'
```

## Recommended Configuration Parameters 

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `messages` | - | - | Array of message objects. Important: Avoid system prompts - include all instructions in the user message! |
| `temperature` |0.6 |0.0 -2.0 | Controls randomness in responses. Lower values make responses more deterministic. Recommended range:0.5-0.7 to prevent repetitions or incoherent outputs |
| `max_completion_tokens` |1024 | - | Maximum length of model's response. Default may be too low for complex reasoning - consider increasing for detailed step-by-step solutions |
| `top_p` |0.95 |0.0 -1.0 | Controls diversity of token selection |
| `stream` | false | boolean | Enables response streaming. Recommended for interactive reasoning tasks |
| `stop` | null | string/array | Custom stop sequences |
| `seed` | null | integer | Set for reproducible results. Important for benchmarking - run multiple tests with different seeds |
| `response_format` | `{type: "text"}` | `{type: "json_object"}` or `{type: "text"}` | Set to `json_object` type for structured output. |
| `reasoning_format` | `raw` | `"parsed"`, `"raw"`, `"hidden"` | Controls how model reasoning is presented in the response. Must be set to either `parsed` or `hidden` when using tool calls or JSON mode. |
| `reasoning_effort` | `default` | `"none"`, `"default"`, `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"` | Controls the level of effort the model will put into reasoning. `none` and `default` are only supported by [Qwen332B](/docs/model/qwen3-32b). `low`, `medium`, and `high` are only supported by [GPT-OSS20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b) and [GPT-OSS120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b). |

## Accessing Reasoning Content

Accessing the reasoning content in the response is dependent on the model and the reasoning format you are using. 

### Non-GPT-OSS Models

When using `raw` reasoning format, the reasoning content is accessible in the main text content of assistant responses. 

When using `parsed` reasoning format, the model's reasoning is separated into a dedicated `reasoning` field, making it easier to access both the final answer and the thinking process programmatically. 

When using `hidden` reasoning format, only the final answer is returned without any visible reasoning content. 

### GPT-OSS Models

With `openai/gpt-oss-20b` and `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, the `reasoning_format` parameter is not supported. These models behave as if `parsed` format was used, automatically separating reasoning content into the `reasoning` field of the assistant response.

## Optimizing Performance 

### Temperature and Token Management
The model performs best with temperature settings between0.5-0.7, with lower values (closer to0.5) producing more consistent mathematical proofs and higher values allowing for more creative problem-solving approaches. Monitor and adjust your token usage based on the complexity of your reasoning tasks - while the default max_completion_tokens is1024, complex proofs may require higher limits.

### Prompt Engineering
To ensure accurate, step-by-step reasoning while maintaining high performance:
- DeepSeek-R1 works best when all instructions are included directly in user messages rather than system prompts. 
- Structure your prompts to request explicit validation steps and intermediate calculations. 
- Avoid few-shot prompting and go for zero-shot prompting only.

## Images and Vision

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/vision

# Images and Vision

Groq API offers fast inference and low latency for multimodal models with vision capabilities for understanding and interpreting visual data from images. By analyzing the content of an image, multimodal models can generate 
human-readable text for providing insights about given visual data. 

## Supported Models

Groq API supports powerful multimodal models that can be easily integrated into your applications to provide fast and accurate image processing for tasks such as visual question answering, caption generation, 
and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## How to Use Vision

Use Groq API vision features via:

- **GroqCloud Console Playground**: Use [Llama4 Scout](/playground?model=meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct) or [Llama4 Maverick](/playground?model=meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct) as the model and
upload your image.
- **Groq API Request:** Call the [`chat.completions`](/docs/text-chat#generating-chat-completions-with-groq-sdk) API endpoint and set the model to `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` or `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct`. 
See code examples below.

<br />
## How to Pass Images from URLs as Input
The following are code examples for passing your image to the model via a URL: 

## How to Pass Locally Saved Images as Input
To pass locally saved images, we'll need to first encode our image to a base64 format string before passing it as the `image_url` in our API request as follows:

<br />

## Tool Use with Images
The `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`, `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` models support tool use! The following cURL example defines a `get_current_weather` tool that the model can leverage to answer a user query that contains a question about the 
weather along with an image of a location that the model can infer location (i.e. New York City) from:

<br />

The following is the output from our example above that shows how our model inferred the state as New York from the given image and called our example function:

<br />

## JSON Mode with Images
The `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` and `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` models support JSON mode! The following Python example queries the model with an image and text (i.e. "Please pull out relevant information as a JSON object.") with `response_format`
set for JSON mode:

<br />

## Multi-turn Conversations with Images
The `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` and `meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct` models support multi-turn conversations! The following Python example shows a multi-turn user conversation about an image:

<br />


## Venture Deeper into Vision

### Use Cases to Explore
Vision models can be used in a wide range of applications. Here are some ideas:

- **Accessibility Applications:** Develop an application that generates audio descriptions for images by using a vision model to generate text descriptions for images, which can then 
be converted to audio with one of our audio endpoints.
- **E-commerce Product Description Generation:** Create an application that generates product descriptions for e-commerce websites.
- **Multilingual Image Analysis:** Create applications that can describe images in multiple languages.
- **Multi-turn Visual Conversations:** Develop interactive applications that allow users to have extended conversations about images.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. The possibilities are endless, and we're excited to see what you create with vision models powered by Groq for low latency and fast inference!

Your Groq Console [dashboard](/dashboard) contains pages for metrics, usage, logs, and more. When you view your Groq API request logs, you'll see important data regarding your API requests. The following are ones relevant to latency that we'll call out and define:

- **Time to First Token (TTFT)**: Time from API request sent to first token received from the model
- **Latency**: Total server time from API request to completion
- **Input Tokens**: Number of tokens provided to the model (e.g. system prompt, user query, assistant message), directly affecting TTFT
- **Output Tokens**: Number of tokens generated, impacting total latency
- **Tokens/Second**: Generation speed of model outputs

### The Complete Latency Picture

The users of the applications you build with APIs in general experience total latency that includes:

`User-Experienced Latency = Network Latency + Server-side Latency`

<small>
Server-side Latency is <a href="https://console.groq.com/dashboard/logs" target="_blank">shown in the console</a>.
</small>

**Important**: Groq Console metrics show server-side latency only. Client-side network latency measurement examples are provided in the Network Latency Analysis section below.

## How Input Size Affects TTFT

Input token count is the primary driver of TTFT performance. Understanding this relationship allows developers to optimize prompt design and context management for predictable latency characteristics.

### The Scaling Pattern

TTFT demonstrates linear scaling characteristics across input token ranges:

- **Minimal inputs (100 tokens)**: Consistently fast TTFT across all model sizes
- **Standard contexts (1K tokens)**: TTFT remains highly responsive
- **Large contexts (10K tokens)**: TTFT increases but remains competitive
- **Maximum contexts (100K tokens)**: TTFT increases to process all the input tokens

### Model Architecture Impact on TTFT

Model architecture fundamentally determines input processing characteristics, with parameter count, attention mechanisms, and specialized capabilities creating distinct performance profiles.

**Parameter Scaling Patterns**:

- **8B models**: Minimal TTFT variance across context lengths, optimal for latency-critical applications
- **32B models**: Linear TTFT scaling with manageable overhead for balanced workloads
- **70B and above**: Exponential TTFT increases at maximum context, requiring context management

**Architecture-Specific Considerations**:

- **Reasoning models**: Additional computational overhead for chain-of-thought processing increases baseline latency by10-40%
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: Router computation adds fixed latency cost but maintains competitive TTFT scaling
- **Vision-language models**: Image encoding preprocessing significantly impacts TTFT independent of text token count

## Output Token Generation Dynamics

Sequential token generation represents the primary latency bottleneck in LLM inference. Unlike parallel input processing, each output token requires a complete forward pass through the model, creating linear scaling between output length and total generation time. Token generation demands significantly higher computational resources than input processing due to the autoregressive nature of transformer architectures.

## Infrastructure Optimization

### Network Latency Analysis

Network latency can significantly impact user-experienced performance. If client-measured total latency substantially exceeds server-side metrics returned in API responses, network optimization becomes critical.

**Diagnostic Approach**:

Compare client vs server latency

- Verify request routing and identify optimization opportunities

The `x-groq-region` header confirms which datacenter processed your request, enabling latency correlation with geographic proximity. This information helps you understand if your requests are being routed to the optimal datacenter for your location.

### Context Length Management

As shown above, TTFT scales with input length. End users can employ several prompting strategies to optimize context usage and reduce latency:

- **Prompt Chaining**: Decompose complex tasks into sequential subtasks where each prompt's output feeds the next. 
- **Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Selection**: For concise, well-defined tasks, zero-shot prompting minimizes context length while leveraging model capabilities. 
- **Strategic Context Prioritization**: Place critical information at prompt beginning or end, as models perform best with information in these positions.

## Groq's Processing Options

### Service Tier Architecture

Groq offers three service tiers that influence latency characteristics and processing behavior:

**On-Demand Processing**: For real-time applications requiring guaranteed processing, the standard API delivers:
- Industry-leading low latency with consistent performance
- Streaming support for immediate perceived response
- Controlled rate limits to ensure fairness and consistent experience

**Flex Processing**: [Flex Processing](/docs/flex-processing) optimizes for throughput with higher request volumes in exchange for occasional failures. 
<br/>
**Auto Processing**: Auto Processing uses on-demand rate limits initially, then automatically falls back to flex tier processing if those limits are exceeded. 

### Batch Processing

[Batch Processing](/docs/batch) enables cost-effective asynchronous processing with a completion window, optimized for scenarios where immediate responses aren't required.

**Latency Considerations**: While batch processing trades immediate response for efficiency, understanding its latency characteristics helps optimize workload planning:

- **Submission latency**: Minimal overhead for batch job creation and validation
- **Queue processing**: Variable based on system load and batch size
- **Completion notification**: Webhook or polling-based status updates
- **Result retrieval**: Standard API latency for downloading completed outputs

## Streaming Implementation

### Server-Sent Events Best Practices

Implement streaming to improve perceived latency:

**Key Benefits**:

- Users see immediate response initiation
- Better user engagement and experience
- Error handling during generation

## Toolhouse 🛠️🏠

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/toolhouse

## Toolhouse 🛠️🏠
[Toolhouse](https://toolhouse.ai) is the first Backend-as-a-Service for the agentic stack. Toolhouse allows you to define agents as configuration, and to deploy them as APIs. Toolhouse agents are automatically connected to 40+ tools including RAG, MCP servers, web search, webpage readers, memory, storage, statefulness and more. With Toolhouse, you can build both conversational and autonomous agents without the need to host and maintain your own infrastructure.

You can use Groq’s fast inference with Toolhouse. This page shows you how to use Llama4 Maverick and Groq’s Compound Beta to build a Toolhouse agent.

### Getting Started

#### Step 1: Download the Toolhouse CLI

Download the Toolhouse CLI by typing this command on your Terminal:

```bash
npm i -g @toolhouseai/cli
```

#### Step 2: Log into Toolhouse

Log into Toolhouse via the CLI:

```bash
th login
```

Follow the instructions to create a free Sandbox account.

#### Step 3: Add your Groq API Key to Toolhouse

Generate a Groq API Key in your [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys), then copy its value.

In the CLI, set your Groq API Key:

```bash
th secrets set GROQ_API_KEY=(replace this with your Groq API Key)
```

You’re all set! From now on, you’ll be able to use Groq models with your Toolhouse agents. For a list of supported models, refer to the [Toolhouse models page](https://docs.toolhouse.ai/toolhouse/bring-your-model#supported-models).

## Using Toolhouse with Llama4 models

To use a specific model, simply reference the model identifier in your agent file, for example:

- For Llama4 Maverick: `@groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct`
- For Llama4 Scout: `@groq/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`

Here’s an example of a working agent file. You can copy this file and save it as `groq.yaml`. In this example, we use an image generation tool, along with Maverick.

```yaml
title: "Maverick Example"
prompt: "Tell me a joke about this topic: {topic} then generate an image!"
vars:
  topic: "bananas"
model: "@groq/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct"
public: true
```

Then, run it:

```yaml
th run groq.yaml
```

You will see something like this:

```bash
━━━━ Stream output for joke ━━━━
Why did the banana go to the doctor? Because it wasn't peeling well!

Using MCP Server: image_generation_flux()

Why did the banana go to the doctor? Because it wasn't peeling well!

![](https://img.toolhouse.ai/tbR5NI.jpg)
━━━━ End of stream for joke ━━━━
```

If the results look good to you, you can deploy this agent using `th deploy groq.yaml`

## Using Toolhouse with Compound Beta

Compound Beta is an advanced AI system that is designed to agentically [search the web and execute code](/docs/agentic-tooling), while being optimized for latency.

To use Compound Beta, simply specify `@groq/compound-beta` or `@groq/compound-beta-mini` as the model identifier. In this example, Compound Beta will search the web under the hood. Save the following file as `groq.yaml`:

```yaml
title: Compound Example
prompt: Who are the Oilers playing against next, and when/where are they playing? Use the current_time() tool to get the current time.
model: "@groq/compound-beta"
```

Run it with the following command:

```bash
th run compound.yaml
```

You will see something like this:

```bash
━━━━ Stream output for compound ━━━━
The Oilers are playing against the Florida Panthers next. The game is scheduled for June 12, 2025, at Amerant Bank Arena.
━━━━ End of stream for compound ━━━━
```

Then to deploy the agent as an API:

```bash
th deploy
```

## Speech to Text

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/speech-to-text

# Speech to Text
Groq API is the fastest speech-to-text solution available, offering OpenAI-compatible endpoints that
enable near-instant transcriptions and translations. With Groq API, you can integrate high-quality audio 
processing into your applications at speeds that rival human interaction. 

## API Endpoints

We support two endpoints:

| Endpoint | Usage | API Endpoint |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transcriptions | Convert audio to text | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions` |
| Translations | Translate audio to English text| `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/translations` |

## Supported Models

| Model ID | Model | Supported Language(s) | Description |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `whisper-large-v3-turbo` | [Whisper Large V3 Turbo](/docs/model/whisper-large-v3-turbo) | Multilingual | A fine-tuned version of a pruned Whisper Large V3 designed for fast, multilingual transcription tasks. |
| `whisper-large-v3` | [Whisper Large V3](/docs/model/whisper-large-v3) | Multilingual | Provides state-of-the-art performance with high accuracy for multilingual transcription and translation tasks. |

  
## Which Whisper Model Should You Use?
Having more choices is great, but let's try to avoid decision paralysis by breaking down the tradeoffs between models to find the one most suitable for
your applications: 
- If your application is error-sensitive and requires multilingual support, use `whisper-large-v3`. 
- If your application requires multilingual support and you need the best price for performance, use `whisper-large-v3-turbo`. 

The following table breaks down the metrics for each model.
| Model | Cost Per Hour | Language Support | Transcription Support | Translation Support | Real-time Speed Factor | Word Error Rate |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| `whisper-large-v3` | $0.111 | Multilingual | Yes | Yes |189 |10.3% |
| `whisper-large-v3-turbo` | $0.04 | Multilingual | Yes | No |216 |12% |


## Working with Audio Files

### Audio File Limitations
- Max File Size: 25 MB (free tier), 100MB (dev tier)
- Max Attachment File Size: 25 MB. If you need to process larger files, use the `url` parameter to specify a url to the file instead.
- Minimum File Length: 0.01 seconds
- Minimum Billed Length: 10 seconds. If you submit a request less than this, you will still be billed for 10 seconds.
- Supported File Types: Either a URL or a direct file upload for `flac`, `mp3`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `mpga`, `m4a`, `ogg`, `wav`, `webm`
- Single Audio Track: Only the first track will be transcribed for files with multiple audio tracks. (e.g. dubbed video)
- Supported Response Formats: `json`, `verbose_json`, `text`
- Supported Timestamp Granularities: `segment`, `word`

### Audio Preprocessing
Our speech-to-text models will downsample audio to 16KHz mono before transcribing, which is optimal for speech recognition. This preprocessing can be performed client-side if your original file is extremely 
large and you want to make it smaller without a loss in quality (without chunking, Groq API speech-to-text endpoints accept up to 25MB for free tier and 100MB for [dev tier](/settings/billing)). For lower latency, convert your files to `wav` format. When reducing file size, we recommend FLAC for lossless compression.

The following `ffmpeg` command can be used to reduce file size:

```shell
ffmpeg \
 -i <your file> \
 -ar 16000 \
 -ac 1 \
 -map0:a \
 -c:a flac \
 <output file name>.flac
```

### Working with Larger Audio Files
For audio files that exceed our size limits or require more precise control over transcription, we recommend implementing audio chunking. This process involves:
1. Breaking the audio into smaller, overlapping segments
2. Processing each segment independently
3. Combining the results while handling overlapping

[To learn more about this process and get code for your own implementation, see the complete audio chunking tutorial in our Groq API Cookbook.](https://github.com/groq/groq-api-cookbook/tree/main/tutorials/audio-chunking)

## Using the API 
The following are request parameters you can use in your transcription and translation requests:
| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | `string` | Required unless using `url` instead | The audio file object for direct upload to translate/transcribe. |
| `url` | `string` | Required unless using `file` instead | The audio URL to translate/transcribe (supports Base64URL). |
| `language` | `string` | Optional | The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 (i.e. `en, `tr`) format will improve accuracy and latency.<br/><br/>The translations endpoint only supports 'en' as a parameter option. |
| `model` | `string` | Required | ID of the model to use.|
| `prompt` | `string` | Optional | Prompt to guide the model's style or specify how to spell unfamiliar words. (limited to 224 tokens) |
| `response_format` | `string` | json | Define the output response format.<br/><br/>Set to `verbose_json` to receive timestamps for audio segments.<br/><br/>Set to `text` to return a text response. |
| `temperature` | `float` | 0 | The temperature between 0 and 1. For translations and transcriptions, we recommend the default value of 0. |
| `timestamp_granularities[]` | `array` | segment | The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. `response_format` must be set `verbose_json` to use timestamp granularities.<br/><br/>Either or both of `word` and `segment` are supported. <br/><br/>`segment` returns full metadata and `word` returns only word, start, and end timestamps. To get both word-level timestamps and full segment metadata, include both values in the array. |

```json
{
 "text": "Your transcribed text appears here...",
 "x_groq": {
 "id": "req_unique_id"
 }
}
```

```

The following is an example response:
```json
{
 "text": "Your translated text appears here...",
 "x_groq": {
 "id": "req_unique_id"
 }
}
```

## Understanding Metadata Fields
When working with Groq API, setting `response_format` to `verbose_json` outputs each segment of transcribed text with valuable metadata that helps us understand the quality and characteristics of our 
transcription, including `avg_logprob`, `compression_ratio`, and `no_speech_prob`. 

This information can help us with debugging any transcription issues. Let's examine what this metadata tells us using a real 
example:
```json
{
 "id": 8,
 "seek": 3000,
 "start": 43.92,
 "end": 50.16,
 "text": " document that the functional specification that you started to read through that isn't just the",
 "tokens": [51061, 4166, 300, 264, 11745, 31256],
 "temperature": 0,
 "avg_logprob": -0.097569615,
 "compression_ratio": 1.6637554,
 "no_speech_prob": 0.012814695
}
```
As shown in the above example, we receive timing information as well as quality indicators. Let's gain a better understanding of what each field means:
- `id: 8`: The 9th segment in the transcription (counting begins at 0)
- `seek`: Indicates where in the audio file this segment begins (3000 in this case)
- `start` and `end` timestamps: Tell us exactly when this segment occurs in the audio (43.92 to 50.16 seconds in our example)
- `avg_logprob` (Average Log Probability): -0.097569615 in our example indicates very high confidence. Values closer to 0 suggest better confidence, while more negative values (like -0.5 or lower) might 
indicate transcription issues.
- `no_speech_prob` (No Speech Probability): 0.012814695 is very low, suggesting this is definitely speech. Higher values (closer to 1) would indicate potential silence or non-speech audio.
- `compression_ratio`: 1.6637554 is a healthy value, indicating normal speech patterns. Unusual values (very high or low) might suggest issues with speech clarity or word boundaries.

### Using Metadata for Debugging
When troubleshooting transcription issues, look for these patterns:
- Low Confidence Sections: If `avg_logprob` drops significantly (becomes more negative), check for background noise, multiple speakers talking simultaneously, unclear pronunciation, and strong accents. 
Consider cleaning up the audio in these sections or adjusting chunk sizes around problematic chunk boundaries.
- Non-Speech Detection: High `no_speech_prob` values might indicate silence periods that could be trimmed, background music or noise, or non-verbal sounds being misinterpreted as speech. Consider noise 
reduction when preprocessing.
- Unusual Speech Patterns: Unexpected `compression_ratio` values can reveal stuttering or word repetition, speaker talking unusually fast or slow, or audio quality issues affecting word separation.

### Quality Thresholds and Regular Monitoring
We recommend setting acceptable ranges for each metadata value we reviewed above and flagging segments that fall outside these ranges to be able to identify and adjust preprocessing or chunking strategies for 
flagged sections. 

By understanding and monitoring these metadata values, you can significantly improve your transcription quality and quickly identify potential issues in your audio processing pipeline. 


## Prompting Guidelines
 The prompt parameter (max 224 tokens) helps provide context and maintain a consistent output style.
 Unlike chat completion prompts, these prompts only guide style and context, not specific actions.

### Best Practices
- Provide relevant context about the audio content, such as the type of conversation, topic, or 
speakers involved.
- Use the same language as the language of the audio file.
- Steer the model's output by denoting proper spellings or emulate a specific writing style or tone.
- Keep the prompt concise and focused on stylistic guidance.

We can't wait to see what you build!

## ✨ Vercel AI SDK + Groq: Rapid App Development

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/ai-sdk

## ✨ Vercel AI SDK + Groq: Rapid App Development

Vercel's AI SDK enables seamless integration with Groq, providing developers with powerful tools to leverage language models hosted on Groq for a variety of applications. By combining Vercel's cutting-edge platform with Groq's advanced inference capabilities, developers can create scalable, high-speed applications with ease.

### Why Choose the Vercel AI SDK?
- A versatile toolkit for building applications powered by advanced language models like Llama3.370B 
- Ideal for creating chat interfaces, document summarization, and natural language generation
- Simple setup and flexible provider configurations for diverse use cases
- Fully supports standalone usage and seamless deployment with Vercel
- Scalable and efficient for handling complex tasks with minimal configuration

### Quick Start Guide in JavaScript (5 minutes to deployment)

####1. Create a new Next.js project with the AI SDK template:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-groq-app --typescript --tailwind --src-dir
cd my-groq-app
```
####2. Install the required packages:
```bash
npm install @ai-sdk/groq ai
npm install react-markdown
```

####3. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and configure your Groq API Key:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

####4. Create a new directory structure for your Groq API endpoint:
```bash
mkdir -p src/app/api/chat
```

####5. Initialize the AI SDK by creating an API route file called `route.ts` in `app/api/chat`:
```javascript
import { groq } from '@ai-sdk/groq';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to30 seconds
export const maxDuration =30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
 const { messages } = await req.json();

 const result = streamText({
 model: groq('llama-3.3-70b-versatile'),
 messages,
 });

 return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

**Challenge**: Now that you have your basic chat interface working, try enhancing it to create a specialized code explanation assistant! 


####6. Create your front end interface by updating the `app/page.tsx` file:
```javascript
'use client';

import { useChat } from 'ai/react';

export default function Chat() {
 const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();

 return (
 <div className="min-h-screen bg-white">
 <div className="mx-auto w-full max-w-2xl py-8 px-4">
 <div className="space-y-4 mb-4">
 {messages.map(m => (
 <div 
 key={m.id} 
 className={`flex ${m.role === 'user' ? 'justify-end' : 'justify-start'}`}
 >
 <div 
 className={`
 max-w-[80%] rounded-lg px-4 py-2
 ${m.role === 'user' 
 ? 'bg-blue-100 text-black' 
 : 'bg-gray-100 text-black'}
 `}
 >
 <div className="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-1">
 {m.role === 'user' ? 'You' : 'Llama3.370B powered by Groq'}
 </div>
 <div className="text-sm whitespace-pre-wrap">
 {m.content}
 </div>
 </div>
 </div>
 ))}
 </div>

 <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="flex gap-4">
 <input
 value={input}
 onChange={handleInputChange}
 placeholder="Type your message..."
 className="flex-1 rounded-lg border border-gray-300 px-4 py-2 text-black focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#f55036]"
 />
 <button 
 type="submit"
 className="rounded-lg bg-[#f55036] px-4 py-2 text-white hover:bg-[#d94530] focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[#f55036]"
 >
 Send
 </button>
 </form>
 </div>
 </div>
 );
}
```

####7. Run your development enviornment to test our application locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

####8. Easily deploy your application using Vercel CLI by installing `vercel` and then running the `vercel` command:

The CLI will guide you through a few simple prompts:
- If this is your first time using Vercel CLI, you'll be asked to create an account or log in
- Choose to link to an existing Vercel project or create a new one
- Confirm your deployment settings 

Once you've gone through the prompts, your app will be deployed instantly and you'll receive a production URL! 🚀
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## Agno + Groq: Lightning Fast Agents

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/agno

## Agno + Groq: Lightning Fast Agents

[Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) is a lightweight framework for building multi-modal Agents. Its easy to use, extremely fast and supports multi-modal inputs and outputs.

With Groq & Agno, you can build:

- **Agentic RAG**: Agents that can search different knowledge stores for RAG or dynamic few-shot learning.
- **Image Agents**: Agents that can understand images and make tool calls accordingly.
- **Reasoning Agents**: Agents that can reason using a reasoning model, then generate a result using another model.
- **Structured Outputs**: Agents that can generate pydantic objects adhering to a schema.

### Python Quick Start (2 minutes to hello world)

Agents are autonomous programs that use language models to achieve tasks. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses.

Let's build a simple web search agent, with a tool to search DuckDuckGo to get better results. 

####1. Create a file called `web_search_agent.py` and add the following code:
```python web_search_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.groq import Groq
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Initialize the agent with an LLM via Groq and DuckDuckGoTools
agent = Agent(
 model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"),
 description="You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!",
 tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], # Add DuckDuckGo tool to search the web
 show_tool_calls=True, # Shows tool calls in the response, set to False to hide
 markdown=True # Format responses in markdown
)

# Prompt the agent to fetch a breaking news story from New York
agent.print_response("Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.", stream=True)
```

####3. Set up and activate your virtual environment:
```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

####4. Install the Groq, Agno, and DuckDuckGo dependencies:
```shell
pip install -U groq agno duckduckgo-search
```

####5. Configure your Groq API Key:
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

####6. Run your Agno agent that now extends your LLM's context to include web search for up-to-date information and send results in seconds:
```shell
python web_search_agent.py
```

### Multi-Agent Teams
Agents work best when they have a singular purpose, a narrow scope, and a small number of tools. When the number of tools grows beyond what the language model can handle or the tools belong to different 
categories, use a **team of agents** to spread the load.

The following code expands upon our quick start and creates a team of two agents to provide analysis on financial markets:
```python agent_team.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.groq import Groq
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

web_agent = Agent(
 name="Web Agent",
 role="Search the web for information",
 model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"),
 tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
 instructions="Always include sources",
 markdown=True,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
 name="Finance Agent",
 role="Get financial data",
 model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"),
 tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True)],
 instructions="Use tables to display data",
 markdown=True,
)

agent_team = Agent(
 team=[web_agent, finance_agent],
 model=Groq(id="llama-3.3-70b-versatile"), # You can use a different model for the team leader agent
 instructions=["Always include sources", "Use tables to display data"],
 # show_tool_calls=True, # Uncomment to see tool calls in the response
 markdown=True,
)

# Give the team a task
agent_team.print_response("What's the market outlook and financial performance of AI semiconductor companies?", stream=True)
```

## Groq Batch API

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/batch

# Groq Batch API
Process large-scale workloads asynchronously with our Batch API. 

## What is Batch Processing?
Batch processing lets you run thousands of API requests at scale by submitting your workload as an asynchronous batch of requests to Groq with50% lower cost, no impact to your standard rate limits, and24-hour to7 day processing window.

## Overview
While some of your use cases may require synchronous API requests, asynchronous batch processing is perfect for use cases that don't need immediate reponses or for processing a large number of queries that standard rate limits cannot handle, such as processing large datasets, generating content in bulk, and running evaluations.

Compared to using our synchronous API endpoints, our Batch API has:
- **Higher rate limits:** Process thousands of requests per batch with no impact on your standard API rate limits
- **Cost efficiency:**50% cost discount compared to synchronous APIs

## Model Availability and Pricing
The Batch API can currently be used to execute queries for chat completion (both text and vision), audio transcription, and audio translation inputs with the following models:

| Model ID | Model |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| openai/gpt-oss-20b | [GPT-OSS20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)

| meta-llama/llama-guard-4-12b | [Llama Guard 4 12B](/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-guard-4-12b)
 

Pricing is at a50% cost discount compared to [synchronous API pricing.](https://groq.com/pricing)

## Getting Started
Our Batch API endpoints allow you to collect a group of requests into a single file, kick off a batch processing job to execute the requests within your file, query for the status of your batch, and eventually 
retrieve the results when your batch is complete.

Multiple batch jobs can be submitted at once.

Each batch has a processing window, during which we'll process as many requests as our capacity allows while maintaining service quality for all users. We allow for setting 
a batch window from24 hours to7 days and recommend setting a longer batch window allow us more time to complete your batch jobs instead of expiring them.

### 1. Prepare Your Batch File
A batch is composed of a list of API requests and every batch job starts with a JSON Lines (JSONL) file that contains the requests
you want processed. Each line in this file represents a single API call.

The Groq Batch API currently supports:
- Chat completion requests through [`/v1/chat/completions`](/docs/text-chat)
- Audio transcription requests through [`/v1/audio/transcriptions`](/docs/speech-to-text)
- Audio translation requests through [`/v1/audio/translations`](/docs/speech-to-text)

The structure for each line must include:
- `custom_id`: Your unique identifier for tracking the batch request
- `method`: The HTTP method (currently `POST` only)
- `url`: The API endpoint to call (one of: `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions`, or `/v1/audio/translations`)
- `body`: The parameters of your request matching our synchronous API format.

The following is an example of a JSONL batch file with different types of requests:


```json
{"custom_id": "request-1", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is2+2?"}]}}
{"custom_id": "request-2", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is2+3?"}]}}
{"custom_id": "request-3", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "count up to1000000. starting with1,2,3. print all the numbers, do not stop until you get to1000000."}]}}
```

#### Converting Sync Calls to Batch Format 
If you're familiar with making synchronous API calls, converting them to batch format is straightforward. Here's how a regular API call transforms
into a batch request:


```json
# Your typical synchronous API call in Python:
response = client.chat.completions.create(
 model="llama-3.1-8b-instant",
 messages=[
 {"role": "user", "content": "What is quantum computing?"}
 ]
)

# The same call in batch format (must be on a single line as JSONL):
{"custom_id": "quantum-1", "method": "POST", "url": "/v1/chat/completions", "body": {"model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is quantum computing?"}]}}
```

### 2. Upload Your Batch File
Upload your `.jsonl` batch file using the Files API endpoint for when kicking off your batch job:

**Note:** The Files API currently only supports `.jsonl` files50,000 lines or less and up to maximum of200MB in size. There is no limit for the 
number of batch jobs you can submit. We recommend submitting multiple shorter batch files for a better chance of completion.

You will receive a JSON response that contains the ID (`id`) for your file object that you will then use to create your batch job:
```json
{
 "id":"file_01jh6x76wtemjr74t1fh0faj5t",
 "object":"file",
 "bytes":966,
 "created_at":1736472501,
 "filename":"input_file.jsonl",
 "purpose":"batch"
}
```

### 3. Create Your Batch Job 
Once you've uploaded your `.jsonl` file, you can use the file object ID (in this case, `file_01jh6x76wtemjr74t1fh0faj5t` as shown in Step2) to create a batch: 

**Note:** The completion window for batch jobs can be set from to24 hours (`24h`) to7 days (`7d`). We recommend setting a longer batch window 
to have a better chance for completed batch jobs rather than expirations for when we are under heavy load.

This request will return a Batch object with metadata about your batch, including the batch `id` that you can use to check the status of your batch:
```json
{
 "id":"batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst2zw",
 "object":"batch",
 "endpoint":"/v1/chat/completions",
 "errors":null,
 "input_file_id":"file_01jh6x76wtemjr74t1fh0faj5t",
 "completion_window":"24h",
 "status":"validating",
 "output_file_id":null,
 "error_file_id":null,
 "finalizing_at":null,
 "failed_at":null,
 "expired_at":null,
 "cancelled_at":null,
 "request_counts":{
 "total":0,
 "completed":0,
 "failed":0
 },
 "metadata":null,
 "created_at":1736472600,
 "expires_at":1736559000,
 "cancelling_at":null,
 "completed_at":null,
 "in_progress_at":null
}
```

### 4. Check Batch Status
You can check the status of a batch any time your heart desires with the batch `id` (in this case, `batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst2zw` from the above Batch response object), which will also return a Batch object:

The status of a given batch job can return any of the following status codes:

| Status | Description |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `validating` | batch file is being validated before the batch processing begins |
| `failed` | batch file has failed the validation process |
| `in_progress` | batch file was successfully validated and the batch is currently being run |
| `finalizing` | batch has completed and the results are being prepared |
| `completed` | batch has been completed and the results are ready |
| `expired` | batch was not able to be completed within the processing window |
| `cancelling` | batch is being cancelled (may take up to10 minutes) |
| `cancelled` | batch was cancelled |

When your batch job is complete, the Batch object will return an `output_file_id` and/or an `error_file_id` that you can then use to retrieve
your results (as shown below in Step5). Here's an example:
```json
{
 "id":"batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst2zw",
 "object":"batch",
 "endpoint":"/v1/chat/completions",
 "errors":[
 {
 "code":"invalid_method",
 "message":"Invalid value: 'GET'. Supported values are: 'POST'","param":"method",
 "line":4
 }
 ],
 "input_file_id":"file_01jh6x76wtemjr74t1fh0faj5t",
 "completion_window":"24h",
 "status":"completed",
 "output_file_id":"file_01jh6xa97be52b7pg88czwrrwb",
 "error_file_id":"file_01jh6xa9cte52a5xjnmnt5y0je",
 "finalizing_at":null,
 "failed_at":null,
 "expired_at":null,
 "cancelled_at":null,
 "request_counts":
 {
 "total":3,
 "completed":2,
 "failed":1
 },
 "metadata":null,
 "created_at":1736472600,
 "expires_at":1736559000,
 "cancelling_at":null,
 "completed_at":1736472607,
 "in_progress_at":1736472601
}
```

### 5. Retrieve Batch Results 
Now for the fun. Once the batch is complete, you can retrieve the results using the `output_file_id` from your Batch object (in this case, `file_01jh6xa97be52b7pg88czwrrwb` from the above Batch response object) and write it to
a file on your machine (`batch_output.jsonl` in this case) to view them:

The output `.jsonl` file will have one response line per successful request line of your batch file. Each line includes the original `custom_id`
for mapping results, a unique batch request ID, and the response:

```json
{"id": "batch_req_123", "custom_id": "my-request-1", "response": {"status_code":200, "request_id": "req_abc", "body": {"id": "completion_xyz", "model": "llama-3.1-8b-instant", "choices": [{"index":0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"}}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens":20, "completion_tokens":5, "total_tokens":25}}}, "error": null}
```

Any failed or expired requests in the batch will have their error information written to an error file that can be accessed via the batch's `error_file_id`. 

**Note:** Results may not appears in the same order as your batch request submissions. Always use the `custom_id` field to match results with your
original request. 


## List Batches
The `/batches` endpoint provides two ways to access your batch information: browsing all batches with cursor-based pagination (using the `cursor` parameter), or fetching specific batches by their IDs.

### Iterate Over All Batches
You can view all your batch jobs by making a call to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/batches`. Use the `cursor` parameter with the `next_cursor` value from the previous response to get the next page of results:

The paginated response includes a `paging` object with the `next_cursor` for the next page:

```json
{
 "object": "list",
 "data": [
 {
 "id": "batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst111",
 "object": "batch",
 "status": "completed",
 "created_at":1736472600,
 // ... other batch fields
 }
 // ... more batches
 ],
 "paging": {
 "next_cursor": "cursor_eyJpZCI6ImJhdGNoXzAxamg2eGE3cmVlbXB2ankifQ"
 }
}
```

### Get Specific Batches
You can check the status of multiple batches at once by providing multiple batch IDs as query parameters to the same `/batches` endpoint. This is useful when you have submitted multiple batch jobs and want to monitor their progress efficiently:

The multi-batch status request returns a JSON object with a `data` array containing the complete batch information for each requested batch:

```json
{
 "object": "list",
 "data": [
 {
 "id": "batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst111",
 "object": "batch",
 "endpoint": "/v1/chat/completions",
 "errors": null,
 "input_file_id": "file_01jh6x76wtemjr74t1fh0faj5t",
 "completion_window": "24h",
 "status": "validating",
 "output_file_id": null,
 "error_file_id": null,
 "finalizing_at": null,
 "failed_at": null,
 "expired_at": null,
 "cancelled_at": null,
 "request_counts": {
 "total":0,
 "completed":0,
 "failed":0
 },
 "metadata": null,
 "created_at":1736472600,
 "expires_at":1736559000,
 "cancelling_at": null,
 "completed_at": null,
 "in_progress_at": null
 },
 {
 "id": "batch_01jh6xa7reempvjyh6n3yst222",
 "object": "batch",

**Note:** You can only request up to200 batch IDs in a single request.


## Batch Size
The Files API supports JSONL files up to50,000 lines and200MB in size. Multiple batch jobs can be submitted at once.

**Note:** Consider splitting very large workloads into multiple smaller batches (e.g.1000 requests per batch) for a better chance at completion 
rather than expiration for when we are under heavy load.

## Batch Expiration
Each batch has a processing window (24 hours to7 days) during which we'll process as many requests as our capacity allows while maintaining service quality for all users. 

**Note:** We recommend setting a longer batch window for a better chance of completing your batch job rather than returning expired jobs when we are under 
heavy load.

Batch jobs that do not complete within their processing window will have a status of `expired`. 

In cases where your batch job expires:
- You are only charged for successfully completed requests
- You can access all completed results and see which request IDs were not processed
- You can resubmit any uncompleted requests in a new batch


## Data Expiration
Input, intermediate files, and results from processed batches will be stored securely for up to30 days in Groq's systems. You may also immediately delete once a processed batch is retrieved.

## Rate limits
The Batch API rate limits are separate than existing per-model rate limits for synchronous requests. Using the Batch API will not consume tokens 
from your standard per-model limits, which means you can conveniently leverage batch processing to increase the number of tokens you process with
us. 

See your limits [here.](https://console.groq.com/settings/limits)

## Rate Limits

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/rate-limits

# Rate Limits
Rate limits act as control measures to regulate how frequently users and applications can access our API within specified timeframes. These limits help ensure service stability, fair access, and protection against misuse so that we can serve reliable and fast inference for all.

## Understanding Rate Limits
Rate limits are measured in:
- **RPM:** Requests per minute
- **RPD:** Requests per day
- **TPM:** Tokens per minute
- **TPD:** Tokens per day
- **ASH:** Audio seconds per hour
- **ASD:** Audio seconds per day

Rate limits apply at the organization level, not individual users. You can hit any limit type depending on which threshold you reach first.

**Example:** Let's say your RPM =50 and your TPM =200K. If you were to send50 requests with only100 tokens within a minute, you would reach your limit even though you did not send200K tokens within those 50 requests.

## Rate Limits
The following is a high level summary and there may be exceptions to these limits. You can view the current, exact rate limits for your organization on the [limits page](/settings/limits) in your account settings.

## Rate Limit Headers
In addition to viewing your limits on your account's [limits](https://console.groq.com/settings/limits) page, you can also view rate limit information such as remaining requests and tokens in HTTP response headers as follows:

The following headers are set (values are illustrative):

## Handling Rate Limits
When you exceed rate limits, our API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP status code.

**Note**: `retry-after` is only set if you hit the rate limit and status code429 is returned. The other headers are always included.

## Code Execution

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/code-execution

# Code Execution

Some models and systems on Groq have native support for automatic code execution, allowing them to perform calculations, run code snippets, and solve computational problems in real-time.

<br />

Only Python is currently supported for code execution.

The use of this tool with a supported model in GroqCloud is not a HIPAA Covered Cloud Service under Groq's Business Associate Addendum at this time. This tool is also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.

## Supported Models

Built-in code execution is supported for the following models and systems:

| Model ID | Model |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| openai/gpt-oss-20b | [OpenAI GPT-OSS20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)
| openai/gpt-oss-120b | [OpenAI GPT-OSS120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)
| compound-beta | [Compound Beta](/docs/compound/systems/compound-beta)
| compound-beta-mini | [Compound Beta Mini](/docs/compound/systems/compound-beta-mini)

<br />

For a comparison between the `compound-beta` and `compound-beta-mini` systems and more information regarding extra capabilities, see the [Compound Systems](/docs/compound/systems#system-comparison) page.

## Quick Start (Compound)

To use code execution with [Groq's Compound systems](/docs/compound), change the `model` parameter to one of the supported models or systems.

*And that's it!*

<br />

When the API is called, it will intelligently decide when to use code execution to best answer the user's query. Code execution is performed on the server side in a secure sandboxed environment, so no additional setup is required on your part.

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing the answer based on code execution results. The model combines computational results with explanatory text to provide a comprehensive response. Use this as the primary output for user-facing applications.

<br />


### Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls  

This shows the model's internal reasoning process and the Python code it executed to solve the problem. You can inspect this to understand how the model approached the computational task and what code it generated. This is useful for debugging and understanding the model's decision-making process.

<br />


### Executed Tools Information

This contains the raw executed tools data, including the generated Python code, execution output, and metadata. You can use this to access the exact code that was run and its results programmatically.

<br />


## Quick Start (GPT-OSS)

To use code execution with OpenAI's GPT-OSS models on Groq ([20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b) & [120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)), add the `code_interpreter` tool to your request.

When the API is called, it will use code execution to best answer the user's query. Code execution is performed on the server side in a secure sandboxed environment, so no additional setup is required on your part.

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing the answer based on code execution results. The model combines computational results with explanatory text to provide a comprehensive response.

<br />


### Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls

This shows the model's internal reasoning process and the Python code it executed to solve the problem. You can inspect this to understand how the model approached the computational task and what code it generated.

<br />


### Executed Tools Information

This contains the raw executed tools data, including the generated Python code, execution output, and metadata. You can use this to access the exact code that was run and its results programmatically.

<br />


## How It Works

When you make a request to a model or system that supports code execution, it:

1. **Analyzes your query** to determine if code execution would be helpful (for compound systems or when tool choice is not set to `required`)
2. **Generates Python code** to solve the problem or answer the question
3. **Executes the code** in a secure sandboxed environment powered by [E2B](https://e2b.dev/)
4. **Returns the results** along with the code that was executed

## Use Cases (Compound)

### Mathematical Calculations

Ask the model to perform complex calculations, and it will automatically execute Python code to compute the result.


### Code Debugging and Testing

Provide code snippets to check for errors or understand their behavior. The model can execute the code to verify functionality.

## Security and Limitations

- Code execution runs in a **secure sandboxed environment** with no access to external networks or sensitive data
- Only **Python** is currently supported for code execution
- The execution environment is **ephemeral** - each request runs in a fresh, isolated environment
- Code execution has reasonable **timeout limits** to prevent infinite loops
- No persistent storage between requests

## Pricing

Code execution is priced at $0.00005 / second of execution.

Please see the [Pricing](https://groq.com/pricing) page for more information.

## Provider Information

Code execution functionality is powered by [E2B](https://e2b.dev/), a secure cloud environment for AI code execution. E2B provides isolated, ephemeral sandboxes that allow models to run code safely without access to external networks or sensitive data.

## Flex Processing

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/flex-processing

# Flex Processing
Flex Processing is a service tier optimized for high-throughput workloads that prioritizes fast inference and can handle occasional request failures. This tier offers significantly higher rate limits while maintaining the same pricing as on-demand processing during beta.

## Availability 
Flex processing is available for all [models](/docs/models) to paid customers only with10x higher rate limits compared to on-demand processing. While in beta, pricing will remain the same as our on-demand tier.

## Service Tiers
- **On-demand (`"service_tier":"on_demand"`):** The on-demand tier is the default tier and the one you are used to. We have kept rate limits low in order to ensure fairness and a consistent experience.
- **Flex (`"service_tier":"flex"`):** The flex tier offers on-demand processing when capacity is available, with rapid timeouts if resources are constrained. This tier is perfect for workloads that prioritize fast inference and can gracefully handle occasional request failures. It provides an optimal balance between performance and reliability for workloads that don't require guaranteed processing.
- **Auto (`"service_tier":"auto"`):** The auto tier uses on-demand rate limits, then falls back to flex tier if those limits are exceeded.

## Using Service Tiers

### Service Tier Parameter
The `service_tier` parameter is an additional, optional parameter that you can include in your chat completion request to specify the service tier you'd like to use. The possible values are:
| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `flex` | Only uses flex tier limits |
| `on_demand` (default) | Only uses on_demand rate limits |
| `auto` | First uses on_demand rate limits, then falls back to flex tier if exceeded |


## Example Usage

### Service Tier Parameter
The `service_tier` parameter is an additional, optional parameter that you can include in your chat completion request to specify the service tier you'd like to use. The possible values are:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `flex` | Only uses flex tier limits |
| `on_demand` (default) | Only uses on_demand rate limits |
| `auto` | First uses on_demand rate limits, then falls back to flex tier if exceeded |

- **Cost Management:** Track spending, set budgets, and implement rate limiting for optimal resource utilization
- **Smart Caching:** Cache frequent responses to reduce API calls while maintaining Groq's speed advantage
- **Spend Tracking:** Track spend for individual API keys, users, and teams

### Quick Start (2 minutes to hello world)

####1. Install the package:
```bash
pip install litellm
```

####2. Set up your API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-groq-api-key"
```

####3. Send your first request:
```python
import os
import litellm

api_key = os.environ.get('GROQ_API_KEY')


response = litellm.completion(
 model="groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile", 
 messages=[
 {"role": "user", "content": "hello from litellm"}
 ],
)
print(response)
```

## Assistant Message Prefilling

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/prefilling

# Assistant Message Prefilling

When using Groq API, you can have more control over your model output by prefilling `assistant` messages. This technique gives you the ability to direct any text-to-text model powered by Groq to:
- Skip unnecessary introductions or preambles
- Enforce specific output formats (e.g., JSON, XML)
- Maintain consistency in conversations

## How to Prefill Assistant Messages
To prefill, simply include your desired starting text in the `assistant` message and the model will generate a response starting with the `assistant` message. 
<br />
**Note:** For some models, adding a newline after the prefill `assistant` message leads to better results.  
<br />
**💡 Tip:** Use the stop sequence (`stop`) parameter in combination with prefilling for even more concise results. We recommend using this for generating code snippets. 


## Example Usage
**Example1: Controlling output format for concise code snippets**
<br />
When trying the below code, first try a request without the prefill and then follow up by trying another request with the prefill included to see the difference!


<br />

**Example2: Extracting structured data from unstructured input**

## Google Cloud Private Service Connect

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/security/gcp-private-service-connect

## Google Cloud Private Service Connect

Private Service Connect (PSC) enables you to access Groq's API services through private network connections, eliminating exposure to the public internet. This guide explains how to set up Private Service Connect for secure access to Groq services.

### Overview

Groq exposes its API endpoints in Google Cloud Platform as PSC _published services_. By configuring PSC endpoints, you can:
- Access Groq services through private IP addresses within your VPC
- Eliminate public internet exposure
- Maintain strict network security controls
- Minimize latency
- Reduce data transfer costs

```ascii
Your VPC Network Google Cloud PSC Groq Network
+------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+
| | | | | |
| +-----------+ | | | | +-----------+ |
| | | | Private | Service | Internal | | Groq | |
| | Your | |10.0.0.x | | | | API | |
| | App +---+--> IP <---+---> Connect <----+--> LB <---+---+ Service | |
| | | | | | | | | |
| +-----------+ | | | | +-----------+ |
| | | | | |
| DNS Resolution | | | | |
| api.groq.com | | | | |
| ->10.0.0.x | | | | |
| | | | | |
+------------------+ +------------------+ +------------------+
```

### Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project with [Private Service Connect enabled](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-consumer)
- VPC network where you want to create the PSC endpoint
- Appropriate IAM permissions to create PSC endpoints and DNS zones
- Enterprise plan with Groq
- Provided Groq with your GCP Project ID
- Groq has accepted your GCP Project ID to our Private Service Connect

### Setup

The steps below use us-central-1 as an example. Make sure you configure your system
according to the region(s) you want to use.

####1. Connect an endpoint

1. Navigate to **Network services** > **Private Service Connect** in your Google Cloud Console
2. Go to the **Endpoints** section and click **Connect endpoint**
 * Under **Target**, select _Published service_
 * For **Target service**, enter a [published service](#published-services) target name.
 * For **Endpoint name**, enter a descriptive name (e.g., `groq-api-psc`)
 * Select your desired **Network** and **Subnetwork**
 * For **IP address**, create and select an internal IP from your subnet
 * Enable **Global access** if you need to connect from multiple regions
3. Click **Add endpoint** and verify the status shows as _Accepted_

####2. Configure Private DNS

1. Go to **Network services** > **Cloud DNS** in your Google Cloud Console
2. Create the first zone for groq.com:
 * Click **Create zone**
 * Set **Zone type** to _Private_
 * Enter a descriptive **Zone name** (e.g., `groq-api-private`)
 * For **DNS name**, enter `groq.com.`
 * Create an `A` record:
 * **DNS name**: `api`
 * **Resource record type**: `A`
 * Enter your PSC endpoint IP address
 * Link the private zone to your VPC network

3. Create the second zone for groqcloud.com:
 * Click **Create zone**
 * Set **Zone type** to _Private_
 * Enter a descriptive **Zone name** (e.g., `groqcloud-api-private`)
 * For **DNS name**, enter `groqcloud.com.`
 * Create an `A` record:
 * **DNS name**: `api.us-central-1`
 * **Resource record type**: `A`
 * Enter your PSC endpoint IP address
 * Link the private zone to your VPC network

####3. Validate the Connection

To verify your setup:

1. SSH into a VM in your VPC network
2. Test DNS resolution for both endpoints:
 ```bash
 dig +short api.groq.com
 dig +short api.us-central-1.groqcloud.com
 ```
 Both should return your PSC endpoint IP address

3. Test API connectivity (using either endpoint):
 ```bash
 curl -i https://api.groq.com
 # or
 curl -i https://api.us-central-1.groqcloud.com
 ```
 Should return a successful response through your private connection

### Published Services

| Service | PSC Target Name | Private DNS Names |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| API | projects/groq-pe/regions/me-central2/serviceAttachments/groqcloud | api.groq.com, api.me-central-1.groqcloud.com |
| API | projects/groq-pe/regions/us-central1/serviceAttachments/groqcloud | api.groq.com, api.us-central-1.groqcloud.com |


### Troubleshooting

If you encounter connectivity issues:

1. Verify DNS resolution is working correctly for both domains
2. Check that your security groups and firewall rules allow traffic to the PSC endpoint
3. Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions
4. Verify the PSC endpoint status is _Accepted_
5. Confirm the model you are requesting is operating in the target region

### Alerting

To monitor and alert on an unexpected change in connectivity status for the PSC endpoint, use a [Google Cloud log-based alerting policy](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/alerting/log-based-alerts).

Below is an example of an alert policy that will alert the given notification channel in the case of a connection being _Closed_. This will require manual intervention to reconnect the endpoint.

```hcl
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "groq_psc" {
 display_name = "Groq - Private Service Connect"
 combiner = "OR"

 conditions {
 display_name = "Connection Closed"
 condition_matched_log {
 filter = <<-EOF
 resource.type="gce_forwarding_rule"
 protoPayload.methodName="LogPscConnectionStatusUpdate"
 protoPayload.metadata.pscConnectionStatus="CLOSED"
 EOF
 }
 }

 notification_channels = [google_monitoring_notification_channel.my_alert_channel.id]
 severity = "CRITICAL"

 alert_strategy {
 notification_prompts = ["OPENED"]

 notification_rate_limit {
 period = "600s"
 }
 }

 documentation {
 mime_type = "text/markdown"
 subject = "Groq forwarding rule was unexpectedly closed"
 content = <<-EOF
 Forwarding rule $${resource.label.forwarding_rule_id} was unexpectedly closed. Please contact Groq Support (support@groq.com) for remediation steps.

 - **Project**: $${project}
 - **Alert Policy**: $${policy.display_name}
 - **Condition**: $${condition.display_name}
 EOF

 links {
 display_name = "Dashboard"
 url = "https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/psc/list/consumers?project=${var.project_id}"
 }
 }
}
```

## API Error Codes and Responses

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/errors

# API Error Codes and Responses

Our API uses standard HTTP response status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In cases of errors, the body of the response will contain a JSON object with details about the error. Below are the error codes you may encounter, along with their descriptions and example response bodies.

## Success Codes

- **200 OK**: The request was successfully executed. No further action is needed.

## Client Error Codes

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax. Review the request format and ensure it is correct.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request was not successful because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource. Ensure the request includes the necessary authentication credentials and the api key is valid.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found. Check the request URL and the existence of the resource.
- **413 Request Entity Too Large**: The request body is too large. Please reduce the size of the request body.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: The request was well-formed but could not be followed due to semantic errors. Verify the data provided for correctness and completeness.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Too many requests were sent in a given timeframe. Implement request throttling and respect rate limits.
- **498 Custom: Flex Tier Capacity Exceeded**: This is a custom status code we use and will return in the event that the flex tier is at capacity and the request won't be processed. You can try again later.
- **499 Custom: Request Cancelled**: This is a custom status code we use in our logs page to signify when the request is cancelled by the caller.

## Server Error Codes

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error occurred on the server. Try the request again later or contact support if the issue persists.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server. This may be a temporary issue; retrying the request might resolve it.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is not ready to handle the request, often due to maintenance or overload. Wait before retrying the request.

## Informational Codes

- **206 Partial Content**: Only part of the resource is being delivered, usually in response to range headers sent by the client. Ensure this is expected for the request being made.

## Error Object Explanation

When an error occurs, our API returns a structured error object containing detailed information about the issue. This section explains the components of the error object to aid in troubleshooting and error handling.

## Error Object Structure

The error object follows a specific structure, providing a clear and actionable message alongside an error type classification:

```json
{
 "error": {
 "message": "String - description of the specific error",
 "type": "invalid_request_error"
 }
}
```

## Components

- **`error` (object):** The primary container for error details.
 - **`message` (string):** A descriptive message explaining the nature of the error, intended to aid developers in diagnosing the problem.
 - **`type` (string):** A classification of the error type, such as `"invalid_request_error"`, indicating the general category of the problem encountered.

## OpenAI Compatibility

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/openai

# OpenAI Compatibility
We designed Groq API to be mostly compatible with OpenAI's client libraries, making it easy to 
configure your existing applications to run on Groq and try our inference speed.
<br />
We also have our own [Groq Python and Groq TypeScript libraries](/docs/libraries) that we encourage you to use.

## Configuring OpenAI to Use Groq API
To start using Groq with OpenAI's client libraries, pass your Groq API key to the `api_key` parameter
and change the `base_url` to `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`:

You can find your API key [here](/keys). 

## Currently Unsupported OpenAI Features

Note that although Groq API is mostly OpenAI compatible, there are a few features we don't support just yet: 

### Text Completions
The following fields are currently not supported and will result in a400 error (yikes) if they are supplied:
- `logprobs`

- `logit_bias`

- `top_logprobs`

- `messages[].name`

- If `N` is supplied, it must be equal to1.

### Temperature
If you set a `temperature` value of0, it will be converted to `1e-8`. If you run into any issues, please try setting the value to a float32 `>0` and `<=2`.

### Audio Transcription and Translation
The following values are not supported:
- `vtt`
- `srt`

## Responses API

Groq also supports the [Responses API](/docs/responses-api), which is a more advanced interface for generating model responses that supports both text and image inputs while producing text outputs. You can build stateful conversations by using previous responses as context, and extend your model's capabilities through function calling to connect with external systems and data sources.

### Feedback
If you'd like to see support for such features as the above on Groq API, please reach out to us and let us know by submitting a "Feature Request" via "Chat with us" in the menu after clicking your organization in the top right. We really value your feedback and would love to hear from you! 

## Next Steps

Migrate your prompts to open-source models using our [model migration guide](/docs/prompting/model-migration), or learn more about prompting in our [prompting guide](/docs/prompting).

## Structured Outputs

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/structured-outputs

# Structured Outputs

Guarantee model responses strictly conform to your JSON schema for reliable, type-safe data structures.

## Introduction
Structured Outputs is a feature that guarantees your model responses strictly conform to your provided [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/overview/what-is-jsonschema), ensuring reliable data structures without missing fields or invalid values.

 

Key benefits:

1. **Type-safe responses:** No need to validate or retry malformed outputs
2. **Programmatic refusal detection:** Detect safety-based model refusals programmatically
3. **Simplified prompting:** No complex prompts needed for consistent formatting

 

In addition to supporting Structured Outputs in our API, our SDKs also enable you to easily define your schemas with [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) to ensure further type safety. The examples below show how to extract structured information from unstructured text.

## Supported models

Structured Outputs is available with the following models:

| Model ID | Model |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| openai/gpt-oss-20b | [GPT-OSS20B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-20b)
| openai/gpt-oss-120b | [GPT-OSS120B](/docs/model/openai/gpt-oss-120b)
| moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct | [Kimi K2 Instruct](/docs/model/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct)
| meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct | [Llama4 Maverick](/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct)
| meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct | [Llama4 Scout](/docs/model/meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct)

 

**Note:** [streaming](/docs/text-chat#streaming-a-chat-completion) and [tool use](/docs/tool-use) are not currently supported with Structured Outputs.

### Getting a structured response from unstructured text

Example Output
```json
{
  "product_name": "UltraSound Headphones",
  "rating": 4.5,
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "key_features": [
    "amazing noise cancellation",
    "all-day battery life",
    "crisp and clear sound quality"
  ]
}
```


### Structured Outputs vs JSON mode
Structured Outputs builds on [JSON Object Mode](#json-object-mode) with enhanced capabilities. Both produce valid JSON, but Structured Outputs goes further by guaranteeing your response matches your schema exactly.

 

We recommend using Structured Outputs instead of JSON Object Mode whenever possible.

## Examples

### SQL Query Generation

You can generate structured SQL queries from natural language descriptions, ensuring proper syntax and including metadata about the query structure.

 

Example Output
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT c.name, c.email, SUM(o.total_amount) as total_order_amount FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND o.total_amount > 500 GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.email ORDER BY total_order_amount DESC",
  "query_type": "SELECT",
  "tables_used": ["customers", "orders"],
  "estimated_complexity": "medium",
  "execution_notes": [
    "Query uses JOIN to connect customers and orders tables",
    "DATE_SUB function calculates 30 days ago from current date",
    "GROUP BY aggregates orders per customer",
    "Results ordered by total order amount descending"
  ],
  "validation_status": {
    "is_valid": true,
    "syntax_errors": []
  }
}
```


### Email Classification

You can classify emails into structured categories with confidence scores, priority levels, and suggested actions.

 

Example Output
```json
{
  "category": "urgent",
  "priority": "critical",
  "confidence_score": 0.95,
  "sentiment": "negative",
  "key_entities": [
    {
      "entity": "production server",
      "type": "system"
    },
    {
      "entity": "2:30 PM EST",
      "type": "datetime"
    },
    {
      "entity": "DevOps Team",
      "type": "organization"
    },
    {
      "entity": "customer-facing services",
      "type": "system"
    }
  ],
  "suggested_actions": [
    "Join emergency call immediately",
    "Escalate to senior DevOps team",
    "Activate incident response protocol",
    "Prepare customer communication",
    "Monitor service restoration progress"
  ],
  "requires_immediate_attention": true,
  "estimated_response_time": "immediate"
}
```


### API Response Validation

You can validate and structure API responses with error handling, status codes, and standardized data formats for reliable integration.

 

Example Output
```json
{
  "validation_result": {
    "is_valid": false,
    "status_code": 400,
    "error_count": 2
  },
  "field_validations": [
    {
      "field_name": "user_id",
      "field_type": "string",
      "is_valid": true,
      "error_message": "",
      "expected_format": "string"
    },
    {
      "field_name": "email",
      "field_type": "string",
      "is_valid": false,
      "error_message": "Invalid email format",
      "expected_format": "valid email address (e.g., user@example.com)"
    }
  ],
  "data_quality_score": 0.7,
  "suggested_fixes": [
    "Fix email format validation to ensure proper email structure",
    "Add proper error handling structure to response"
  ],
  "compliance_check": {
    "follows_rest_standards": false,
    "has_proper_error_handling": false,
    "includes_metadata": false
  }
}
```


## Schema Validation Libraries

When working with Structured Outputs, you can use popular schema validation libraries like [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for TypeScript and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for Python. These libraries provide type safety, runtime validation, and seamless integration with JSON Schema generation.

### Support Ticket Classification

This example demonstrates how to classify customer support tickets using structured schemas with both Zod and Pydantic, ensuring consistent categorization and routing.

Example Output
```json
{
  "category": "feature_request",
  "priority": "low",
  "urgency_score": 2.5,
  "customer_info": {
    "name": "Mike",
    "company": "StartupXYZ",
    "tier": "paid"
  },
  "technical_details": [
    {
      "component": "dashboard",
      "description": "Request for dark mode feature"
    },
    {
      "component": "user_interface",
      "description": "Request for keyboard shortcuts"
    }
  ],
  "keywords": ["dark mode", "dashboard", "keyboard shortcuts", "enhancement"],
  "requires_escalation": false,
  "estimated_resolution_hours": 40,
  "summary": "Feature request for dark mode and keyboard shortcuts from paying customer"
}
```


## Implementation Guide

### Schema Definition

Design your JSON Schema to constrain model responses. Reference the [examples](#examples) above and see [supported schema features](#schema-requirements) for technical limitations.

 

**Schema optimization tips:**
- Use descriptive property names and clear descriptions for complex fields
- Create evaluation sets to test schema effectiveness
- Include titles for important structural elements

### API Integration

Include the schema in your API request using the `response_format` parameter:

```json
response_format: { 
  type: "json_schema", 
  json_schema: { 
    name: "schema_name", 
    schema: … 
  } 
}
```


### Error Handling

Schema validation failures return HTTP 400 errors with the message `Generated JSON does not match the expected schema. Please adjust your prompt.`

 

**Resolution strategies:**
- Retry requests for transient failures
- Refine prompts for recurring schema mismatches
- Simplify complex schemas if validation consistently fails

### Best Practices

**User input handling:** Include explicit instructions for invalid or incompatible inputs. Models attempt schema adherence even with unrelated data, potentially causing hallucinations. Specify fallback responses (empty fields, error messages) for incompatible inputs.

 

**Output quality:** Structured outputs guarantee schema compliance but not semantic accuracy. For persistent errors, refine instructions, add system message examples, or decompose complex tasks. See the [prompt engineering guide](/docs/prompting) for optimization techniques.

## Schema Requirements

Structured Outputs supports a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/docs) subset with specific constraints for performance and reliability.

### Supported Data Types

- **Primitives:** String, Number, Boolean, Integer
- **Complex:** Object, Array, Enum
- **Composition:** anyOf (union types)

### Mandatory Constraints

**Required fields:** All schema properties must be marked as `required`. Optional fields are not supported.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "task_name": {"type": "string"},
    "due_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}
  },
  "required": ["task_name", "due_date"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```


**Closed objects:** All objects must set `additionalProperties: false` to prevent undefined properties. This ensures strict schema adherence.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "age": {"type": "integer"}
  },
  "required": ["name", "age"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```


**Union types:** Each schema within `anyOf` must comply with all subset restrictions:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "payment_method": {
      "anyOf": [
        {"type": "string", "enum": ["credit_card", "paypal"]},
        {"type": "null"}
      ]
    }
  },
  "required": ["payment_method"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```


**Reusable subschemas:** Define reusable components with `$defs` and reference them using `$ref`:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "$defs": {
    "address": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "street": {"type": "string"},
        "city": {"type": "string"}
      },
      "required": ["street", "city"]
    }
  },
  "properties": {
    "billing_address": {"$ref": "#/$defs/address"},
    "shipping_address": {"$ref": "#/$defs/address"}
  },
  "required": ["billing_address", "shipping_address"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```


**Root recursion:** Use `#` to reference the root schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {"type": "string"},
    "address": {"$ref": "#"}
  },
  "required": ["name", "address"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```


**Explicit recursion** through definition references:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "$defs": {
    "node": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {"type": "string"},
        "children": {"type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/node"}}
      },
      "required": ["name", "children"]
    }
  },
  "properties": {
    "root": {"$ref": "#/$defs/node"}
  },
  "required": ["root"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```


## JSON Object Mode

JSON Object Mode provides basic JSON output validation without schema enforcement. Unlike Structured Outputs, it guarantees valid JSON syntax but not schema compliance. Use Structured Outputs when available for your use case.

 

Enable JSON Object Mode by setting `response_format` to `{ "type": "json_object" }`.

 

**Requirements and limitations:**
- Include explicit JSON instructions in your prompt (system message or user input)
- Outputs are syntactically valid JSON but may not match your intended schema
- Combine with validation libraries and retry logic for schema compliance

### Sentiment Analysis Example

This example shows prompt-guided JSON generation for sentiment analysis, adaptable to classification, extraction, or summarization tasks:

Example Output
```json
{
  "sentiment_analysis": {
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "confidence_score": 0.84,
    "key_phrases": [
      {
        "phrase": "absolutely love this product",
        "sentiment": "positive"
      },
      {
        "phrase": "quality exceeded my expectations",
        "sentiment": "positive"
      }
    ],
    "summary": "The reviewer loves the product's quality, but was slightly disappointed with the shipping time."
  }
}
```


**Response structure:**
- **sentiment**: Classification (positive/negative/neutral) 
- **confidence_score**: Confidence level (0-1 scale)
- **key_phrases**: Extracted phrases with individual sentiment scores
- **summary**: Analysis overview and main findings

## Web Search

URL: https://console.groq.com/docs/web-search

# Web Search
Some models and systems on Groq have native support for access to real-time web content, allowing them to answer questions with up-to-date information beyond their knowledge cutoff. API responses automatically include citations with a complete list of all sources referenced from the search results.

## Supported Models

Built-in web search is supported for the following models and systems:

| Model ID | Model |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| compound-beta | [Compound Beta](/docs/compound/systems/compound-beta)
| compound-beta-mini | [Compound Beta Mini](/docs/compound/systems/compound-beta-mini)

<br />

For a comparison between the `compound-beta` and `compound-beta-mini` systems and more information regarding extra capabilities, see the [Compound Systems](/docs/compound/systems#system-comparison) page.

## Quick Start

To use web search, change the `model` parameter to one of the supported models.

*And that's it!*

<br />

When the API is called, it will intelligently decide when to use search to best answer the user's query. These tool calls are performed on the server side, so no additional setup is required on your part to use agentic tooling.

### Final Output

This is the final response from the model, containing the synthesized answer based on web search results. The model combines information from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive response with automatic citations. Use this as the primary output for user-facing applications.

<br />

### Reasoning and Internal Tool Calls

This shows the model's internal reasoning process and the search queries it executed to gather information. You can inspect this to understand how the model approached the problem and what search terms it used. This is useful for debugging and understanding the model's decision-making process.

<br />

### Search Results

These are the raw search results that the model retrieved from the web, including titles, URLs, content snippets, and relevance scores. You can use this data to verify sources, implement custom citation systems, or provide users with direct links to the original content. Each result includes a relevance score from0 to1.

## Search Settings

Customize web search behavior by using the `search_settings` parameter. This parameter allows you to exclude specific domains from search results or restrict searches to only include specific domains. These parameters are supported for both `compound-beta` and `compound-beta-mini`.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `exclude_domains` | `string[]` | List of domains to exclude when performing web searches. Supports wildcards (e.g., "*.com") |
| `include_domains` | `string[]` | Restrict web searches to only search within these specified domains. Supports wildcards (e.g., "*.edu") |
| `country` | `string` | Boost search results from a specific country. This will prioritize content from the selected country in the search results. |

### Domain Filtering with Wildcards

Both `include_domains` and `exclude_domains` support wildcard patterns using the `*` character. This allows for flexible domain filtering:

- Use `*.com` to include/exclude all .com domains
- Use `*.edu` to include/exclude all educational institutions
- Use specific domains like `example.com` to include/exclude exact matches

You can combine both parameters to create precise search scopes. For example:
- Include only .com domains while excluding specific sites
- Restrict searches to specific country domains
- Filter out entire categories of websites

### Search Settings Examples

## Pricing

Web search is priced at $5 /1K queries.

Please see the [Pricing](https://groq.com/pricing) page for more information.

## Provider Information

Web search functionality is powered by [Tavily](https://tavily.com/), a search API optimized for AI applications. Tavily provides real-time access to web content with intelligent ranking and citation capabilities specifically designed for language models.

 model: "compound-beta",
 messages: [
 {
 role: "user",
 content: "What happened in AI last week? Provide a list of the most important model releases and updates."
 },
 ]
});

// Final output
console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);

// Reasoning + internal tool calls
console.log(response.choices[0].message.reasoning);

// Search results from the tool calls
console.log(response.choices[0].message.executed_tools?.[0].search_results);
